{"asin": "B00014GT78", "reviewText": "I LOVE this stuff and here's why:I'm an acne sufferer with sensitive/oily skin. I DO NOT have deep acne scars anymore since I have gotten laser treatment done on my skin almost a year ago. Therefore I cannot comment on how well the product applies over scarring. But, I occasionally do still break out. The one thing I hate the most is when I buy $50 makeup that looks flawless but then the red dots start to resurface after so many hours of wear. I decided to purchase Dermablend after watching a YouTube tutorial on it. I figured why not. I've been using it for roughly a month and it's been good to me. 1). It doesnt make me break out. 2). When I apply it over a break out it DOESNT make it worse! 3). It doesnt slide off like average makeup (this is definitely all day wear kinda stuff). 4). The coverage is absolutely phenomenal. I've never in my life been complimented for having pretty skin but I am now! 5). Many foundations are notorious for having that &#34;I can feel my makeup clogging my pores&#34; sensation. I don't have that issue with dermablend which is good news for me because my oily skin hates everything.Here's my advice if you're planning on buying:1. This is pretty heavy duty stuff so I wouldn't apply it every day. It might irritate your skin because it's pretty thick2. Only use it as a concealer. I know many of us hate our skin but not letting it breathe isn't helping anyone3. Blend Blend Blend! This isn't like your average concealer where you dab twice and done. You really have to blend it nicely or else it will look cakey. Beauty takes time ladies.4. A little goes a very very long way. This stuff might seem sad because it comes in a very small container but trust me. It's amazing how well it spreads. A tiny tip of the finger amount was enough to cover my whole face! So, you're definitely getting your money's worth.5. If you are planning on using it as a full face foundation the little spatula thing that comes with it is great. If you're just planning on using it as a concealer a tiny makeup brush to apply it works better.In the long run, I'd recommend this stuff to anyone. If you're curious about how it might look over acne scars do some research. I've read some reviews that say it accentuates their acne scars but I personally think it may be due to a lack of blending. This is also a possible reason why some people may think it looks cakey.

I had a Champion that I bought before the Internet existed -- in those days I had to get one through some co-op group. They still come with a 10-year warranty, as compared to Breville which only comes with a 1-year limited warranty.They mention using a plastic bag and not only is that not good for our environment (I luckily have a garbage disposal) but in using a bag you never get to notice that sometimes the juicer throws out chunks and slices of fruits and vegetables.I was juicing for a larger quantity than is allowed on a Champion (although they do sell commercial ones now) and at about 20-25 years of having it, I was pushing it past it's limit. It started overheating and seemed to be smoking at one point. Obviously it was time for a new juicer. I received the Breville as a gift and am really grateful for it and it's speed, but keeping in mind the current working condition of my Champion, and that it is meant to juice fruit and vegetables not pulp, here are my following results:I juiced what ended up to be 196oz of juice on my Breville. The pulp is always much heavier and wetter than anything that would come out of my Champion, which is always extremely light and dry. I took the pulp in my now, pushed beyond it's limits and not up to top speed Champion, and fed the pulp and got 52oz more of juice. If my math is right that is 26% more juice that I would have thrown out, and if my Champion was in peak performance the ratio I'm sure would have been higher.

There are, so far, 7 adults and 2 children and they LOVE their fried chicken, so I usually fry the equivalent of 2 1/2 chickens (leaves leftovers.)These pans don't stick (and I'm careful to use only wood or plastic and I do NOT store the cord unit inside the pan!) I can cover the entire kitchen island with newspaper and set up the assembly line for draining the chicken after its buttermilk marinade, seasoning it and then flouring it. Then into the pans and, when the chicken is done, onto racks to drain. These two pans hold all the chicken pieces and cook them evenly (each holds one small can of Crisco which is, of course, the only thing chicken should be pan fried in - and the only time I ever use shortening to cook!) Then one pan is used for gravy.I have TWO of these pans that I bought for this purpose. They are perfect. I also make a sauteed chicken the family loves that these pans come out for when I do a lot. And when I brown chicken pieces for stewed chicken, they will hold a LOT of chicken so I can do it all at once instead of in shifts (my family clearly loves chicken.)The kids just left after their first fried chicken of the cold weather season and my eldest, who tried \"Mom's chicken\" for his wife and son a couple of weeks ago, hinted that a pan like mine would be appreciated for Christmas.

My family on the average buys 1-2 tubs of ice cream per week.

It also gives you a lot of room to for experimentation to make healthy and guilt-free ice cream that every body can enjoy in you household. It is so easy to use this appliance, you will not get tired of using it, much less come up with ideas on the kind of flavors and varieties that you can think of. For our first ice cream, we tried to do a cookies n' cream variety since this is one of our favorites. Since we want it to be healthy, we \"improvised\" to put in healthy ingredients as much as we can---fat free cream, fat free milk, splenda, crushed oreos, some mangoes and strawberries. Once it is in the mixing bowl, turn it on and watch the paddle turn, eventually adding your solid ingredients as the cream and milk starts to thicken. After everything is done, chill in the freezer and after dinner time, all of you can enjoy healthy ice cream. I didn't realize making your ice cream could be this easy and fun! Since you can customize the flavors and ingredients to your needs and liking, the variations on how you want to make your ice cream is unlimited!

{"asin": "B005TA1IUW", "reviewText": "This week, I received a nifty new item from Ozeri to review. It is called the Serafino - 2 Double-Wall Thermo Glasses (12.oz). The glasses are made of heat and shatter resistant, borosilicate glass. Each glass has a double-wall design (patent-pending) which is meant to keep the outside glass cool with hot drinks and free of condensation with chilled beverages. There is a wraparound contour, giving an effortless grip. The thermo glass is stronger and more durable than common glass. It is dishwasher safe, microwave safe and freezer safe.I have heard of these types of glasses, but the Serafino - 2 Double-Wall Thermo Glasses are the first pair I have owned. When removing the glasses from the box, my first thought was that glasses felt extremely light, so I was very careful when picking them up. I checked out a few other reviews about these types of glasses breaking easily, so I was hesitant about putting anything hot in them, but I'm glad to say that I poured hot coffee into the glass without the glass breaking and my coffee stayed hot. I tried out the second glass by pouring Diet Dr. Pepper over ice and it stayed cold with no condensation. I haven't had time to try the glasses in the oven yet. With the glasses being so light, I carefully washed them by hand with soap and water. Since then, I have washed them in the dishwasher and they came out fine; just make sure to lightly position the glasses in the dishwasher first. Of course any type of glass can be bumped or dropped, shattering it in dozens of pieces, so always be careful when using one. Overall, I like the design of the Serafino - 2 Double-Wall Thermo Glasses and they do keep liquids hot or cold. Only time will tell how long the glasses will actually last.*Disclaimer - I received a complimentary copy in exchange for my honest review.

My next favorite, in terms of taste and quality, is the NOW tru food vegan.

{"asin": "B00BLQG6D2", "reviewText": "I was interested in getting this seat cushion because I have scoliosis, which from a sitting standpoint means that it is very difficult for me to sit still. I tend to shift positions every few minutes because I just can't keep comfortable. Years of slouching at my desk at my computer don't help that. So I was hoping this seat cushion could help relieve some of the discomfort that I deal with on a daily basis. What I have found over the last couple days that I've had it is that this cushion is very good and very useful in the right conditions.The cushion itself is approximately the size of a standard chair bottom. It has two cushions, really, one for each cheek, with lots of holes for ventilation and two handles on the side. I am not sure of the point of the ventilation holes. I guess they are to help reduce any sweat that could form from sitting on a seat cushion, and if that's the case then they seem to work great. Because the cushion has two halves, it can be folded up and then carried like a briefcase by the handles. It weighs a few pounds, more than you'd think, actually. The surface is pretty firm while still giving a little underneath. It won't buckle under you or feel like a pillow, but it doesn't feel like a rock, either. It is actually very well-designed in that regard. The bottom is a firm, textured surface that helps reduce the potential for it to slide around under you when you get up or sit down. The included instruction manual (yes) will tell you how to use it, but it's also just common sense. It's a seat cushion.My primary use for this cushion is at my desk, and this is where I spend a good amount of time. The cushion fits very well into the seat of my chair and, handles aside, it looks okay. You can see in the product photos that the handles stick out the side when it's flattened out. The cushion is about an inch and a half tall, so it does make me sit higher (make sure you have space under your desk to fit your legs! I actually barely have enough room myself). I have found it to be very comfortable to sit on for long periods of time and it has really been a blessing to have this. I find that I am sitting in the same position for much, much longer now and even, as they advertise, having a bit better posture because of it. I find that I'm not hunching over so much but rather sitting straighter as I type and work. My posture isn't perfect, but that's also due to years of having poor posture. It'll take time to train myself to have better posture. Anyway, this is a situation in which I have found this cushion to be perfectly suited, the typical desk chair.My other tests did not fare as well. I also tested this on both of our sofas. In both cases the sofa cushions go down with my weight and it is just really awkward having this extra cushion under me having a hard surface in the middle of the softer sofa cushions. I do not recommend using this on your sofas. I also tried this in my car, a Honda Civic. This will be an individual thing, but I cannot use it in the car. I'm 6'3\", and with this cushion under me, my head rubs against the ceiling of the car. Other than that I think it would be fine to have under me while driving. I just can't use it because I'm too tall.All in all, this is a very good seat cushion that truly is making a difference in my comfort level. In the right situations, it is very helpful, but that all depends on where you plan to use it. If you, like me, have poor posture and/or difficulty staying still in seats, I highly recommend you try this out.", "categories": ["Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Massage & Relaxation"], "coreclasses": [["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Nutrition Bars"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Protein"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Post-Workout & Recovery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Amino Acids"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Stationery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Gift Wrapping Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Health Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Mirrors"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Hair Coloring Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Nail Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Makeup Brushes & Tools"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Nails"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Makeup Sets"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories"], ["Beauty", "Makeup"], ["Beauty", "Bath & Body"], ["Beauty"]]}

Things get a little brighter and my vision gets crisper. I also can focus on the exercise and not be so distracted.My only issue with ALC is that its long-term safety isn't really known, nor is there a standard dose. Because of this, I only use it a few times a week, just to be safe. On other days I work out, I use DMAE or Beta-Alanine.

The Remington is also louder than my Norelco but the trimmer works *much* better.  I found it harder to get a smooth shave along my jawline, but my teenage son preferred it to the Norelco.  I thought the pivoting head was a little annoying, but it has a lock to hold it firmly in place.  It's also very easy to clean and the 'blades' can be rinsed in water.  It charges very quickly and holds it almost as long as my Norelco.  Also, the handle is comfortable but I accidentally turned it off mid-shave several times because of the position of the button.So, my son really likes it (4 stars from him) but I went back to my Norelco (3 stars from me).", "categories": ["Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Shaving & Hair Removal"], "coreclasses": [["Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Shaving & Hair Removal"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Ear Care"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Therapeutic Skin Care"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Stress Reduction"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Smoking Cessation"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Health Care"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Household Supplies", "Cleaning Tools"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Household Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care"], ["Beauty", "Hair Care", "Hair & Scalp Treatments"], ["Beauty", "Hair Care", "Hair Loss Products"], ["Beauty", "Hair Care", "Styling Products"], ["Beauty", "Hair Care", "Hair Color"], ["Beauty", "Hair Care"], ["Beauty", "Skin Care", "Face"], ["Beauty", "Skin Care", "Sun"], ["Beauty", "Skin Care"]]}

But for more...Meh.Pros:-Cute lamp that works-Battery powered and small. Thus portable.-Kit has Full sized base/top coat. Full sized bonder. 5 mini colors.---First Crush: Pale pink....kind of too translucent imo. Would be good for a french manicure, but it definitely takes some layering before it becomes opaque---Dynamic Duo: described as a dark mauve, but actually I think it makes me think of a more dark pink. Mauve makes me think there's some purple in it...there's not.---Mermaid: not precisely a Tiffany blue. I think it's darker than say China Glaze's Audrey by quite a bit. More of a darkdark Tiffany blue--Diamonds: Takes some buildup to get opaque. It's a silver glitter. It's decent.--The last one is actually the only one I haven't tested/swatched yet...but it looks red orange in the bottle.-Gel feels good, cures very bright and shiny. Feels nice and solid.CONSNo matter how hard I tried and how many layers, the polish actually shrinks as it cures, revealing the tips of my nails. It's very strange. I did 3 coats and you can still see the \"white\" of my fingernails. I even tried painting practically over and UNDER the tips but it still shrunk away revealing my whites.Can't fit the whole hand, but I've actually found that I can do the fingers + the thumb of my opposite hand at the same time...so those who don't want to have to cure a total of 4 times per round...that's my suggestion over trying to shove your whole hand in (I have a small hand too).Still...I wish it didn't shrink back and that the opacity was better on the First Crush and the MermaidIf Hautelook has another sale, I might contemplate buying some more colors....Anything more than thirty...I wouldn't keep. But for a starter gel kit? It's not bad at all and I'm a sucker for the heartshaped LED lamp and I love that the base/top coat is a 2 in 1.If you have never gone gel...the costco price isn't bad to start you out.Yes, there are stronger lamps out there...and some that have plugs instead of batteries.....and some even have timers (this does not, you gotta use a separate one, like your phone)..still...the heart shape...so cuteUPDATE: 11/15/2013 - just a small one :)Have tried sandwiching regular nail polish in between the gel base/top.....don't do it. LOL It gets wrinkly.Tried a different gel color brand (sally hansen) and I am getting barely any white tips! So that's a huge plus for me. Only downside is, like all gel bottles, it too, is quite tiny...the \"mini\" description I gave earlier is incorrect in that it implies that the gel color comes in bigger bottles...it does not, which seems to be true for all gel brands. I tried Sally's Commander in Chic...it ends up curing pretty dark taupe...not sure if I love it...especially at $12? Meh. Trying to sandwich in RCM colors next (soon as my shipment arrives!) but so far...Sally brand is better for color than it's own NailUV colors!Still.

{"asin": "B000I5MJ8S", "reviewText": "I have been wearing liquid foundation for twenty years. I have tried every newfangled way of applying it: from expensive foundation brushes, all types of sponges and of course, my fingers. I always go back to application by finger. Seems the easiest and most effective way. Then I saw Beauty Blender in a YouTube video. It intrigued me. I watched a few You tube tutorials, and decided I should buy one. At twenty bucks for one sponge, it is pricey, but I went for it, but keeping my expectation level down. I've tried too many gimmicks... but this is no gimmick. It REALLY WORKS! It transforms your foundation to an airbrushed look. So easy to apply (just make sure sponge is damp), and apply in a bouncing/stippling motion. You need very little foundation with this method... so what you pay for the BeautyBlender you may actually save on buying less foundation.I use Liquid Foundation (Clinique Repairwear - $29 a bottle). But I think you can use the BeautyBlender with cream or mineral foundation. I also use the pointed end of the Beauty Blender to stipple on my eye concealer -- I use either Bobbi Brown or Amazing Cosmetics (both are dense creams). Does a good job of applying the concealer.Now about  the BB cleanser:1) The Pink Dye does run when I use the Beauty Blender Cleanser. Don't has this issue if I use mild hand soap or Clinique \"Take the Day Off\" Makeup remover. Hmmm????2) I don't  like the method of dispensing the cleanser. The five ounce version has a pump dispensing method which means you have to place the BeautyBlender on the pump to release the cleanser liquid. The foundation transfers from the BB to the pump, so you have to clean that up. Yuck! The 3 ounce bottle is a  squeeze/pour dispenser.Overall, hands down, one of my best beauty purchases EVER!Suggest you go on YouTube and and view some BeautyBlender tutorials.

The other sets went to able bodied friends who had been to my home and got a kick out of using them.  These are especially nice because they are a matched set. The salt mill is specifically made for grinding salt; its not just a pepper mill with salt in it. These would make great Christmas gifts, wedding gifts, thank you gifts, whatever you can think of. Give a set to grandma and grandpa. They might appreciate it because their hands may be arthritic and not able to use regular pepper grinders.  Give a gift to yourself because these are neat and fun to use. I love the reaction the first time someone uses these! One note: We go through a lot of pepper. I guess we like pepper!  If you're not used to using a salt or pepper mill, go easy the first time. The freshly ground stuff is a lot more potent than the regular pepper you buy at the store. The first set of batteries seem to wear out rather quickly. But the next set seems to last a little longer. Loading the mills can be a little tricky.

The pack dissolves and then you put your clothes in the dryer and viola.  However, I have to be totally honest; I don't see any difference in my clothes after using this product.  The clothes don't seem to be any softer or smell any different.  It should be noted this product has a lavender scent, which is the same scent I use with standard fabric softener sheets in my dryer.I have used these fabric softener packs on about 4 to 6 loads of laundry; ranging from towels, socks, boxer shorts, pants, jeans, t-shirts and dress shirts.  I see no difference in softness or smell compared to the standard box of fabric softener sheets.  Actually, the sheets have a more lasting fragrance, not to mention they are less expensive.

I have them in a pair of neutral New Balance running shoes that I liked except they lacked sufficient arch support. These Aetrex insoles definitely provide enough arch support for me, almost too much in fact. I am 6'2\" and 201 pounds and run about 20 miles per week and am therefore pretty hard on footwear. These have proven to be quite resilient and durable and I recommend them to anyone who has an appropriate foot shape to need the level of support they provide. I have noticed that my feet and knees feel better after running with these in the shoes (versus the stock New Balance insole,) but they do take some getting used to. I find the arch support to rise and fall without much subtlety under the midfoot area, which feels a bit akin to having half a tennis ball under your arch for lack of a better analogy. I'm not discouraging their use in any way, but I think my arch shape is a bit less highly sloped at the margins for these to be quite perfect. I plan on using these until they wear out (which at this rate could take a while; I've been running with them for two months now) and then trying something else.

It surprises me that if you want a stick vac for $100 or less you either need a cord or some NiCad / NiMH battery.  Those never last and you end up hating the unit because of a bad battery selection.  And a cord?  Come on, this is why I want something like this so I DON'T need a cord.

So nice when you are trying to straighten up.  But is it worth paying a premium?  Read on...I went around and around on the price.  Should I fork out for a premium for a battery alone or should I get a cord, or should I wait?  Luckily I found a work around.  Shop around (including Amazon from time to time) and you will find a factory refurbished unit.  I did and we got the vacuum for $100 delivered.

I can't use the velcro strap in the back because it's really itchy and it doesn't help keep the strap in place at all. So I'll use it until I find something better.Updated again 10/18/13: I've been using it almost every night because I haven't found the time to find anything better. It's pretty much lost all its stretch and it's frayed, but it's still usable. I've discovered that if I make two ponytails in my hair, one right on top of the other, I can fit this band between the ponytails to keep it in place without having to use the self sticking sports wrap on it. All in all, I guess it was worth the $8 +$5 shipping, but only if it holds up a while longer. I'll leave the 3 stars.First of all, this strap came in two pieces and it should have been obvious how to put it together, but it wasn't and no instructions were included. One part was a thin strap with velcro that goes behind the head and the second part is the wide part that goes around the top of your head. There is a slit where the small strap is inserted on one side of the big strap but no slit on the other side, so I just stuck it together the best I could, although this made the whole assembly asymmetrical and lumpy. It's quite possible I put it together wrong, but there's no way to tell. I can't tell if the product is just poorly made or I got a defective one or if I put it together wrong.I spent way too much time trying to figure out a way to put it together to make it say on my head. I finally figured out a way to sort of keep it on my head, but it was pretty uncomfortable because the itchy velcro part kept slipping and settling on my ears. I finally cut up an old t-shirt and put the cloth between the strap and my ears to protect them which helped with the abrasive parts of the strap.But the big strap that goes over the top of the head to the chin slips all over the place, so I thought maybe I had it inside out, but it slipped either way. I woke up several times during the night with it all tangled up and I finally just took the thing off.I had been wearing self sticking sports wrap (coban) with one strip around my head, which while it worked very well, it was mega ugly and got bunched up too easily so I had to get a new strip every few days.I'm going to try it a few more times and see if I can get it configured so it doesn't eat my ears, slip all over the place and actually hold my jaw shut.If I get it worked out, I'll edit this post to let you all know.", "categories": ["Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Sleep & Snoring"], "coreclasses": [["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Nutrition Bars"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Protein"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Post-Workout & Recovery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Amino Acids"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Stationery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Gift Wrapping Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Health Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Mirrors"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Hair Coloring Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Nail Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Makeup Brushes & Tools"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Nails"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Makeup Sets"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories"], ["Beauty", "Makeup"], ["Beauty", "Bath & Body"], ["Beauty"]]}

{"asin": "B004S6DVMQ", "reviewText": "*Revised Review (see original review below):So we allowed our son to open up his first gift from Santa a bit early, because we wanted him to have something new to play with on the airplane ride to Grandma and Grandpa's house in Miami. So we gave it to him, and boy oh boy was he excited! But we were less than thrilled. First of all, there is no off switch. This toy is extremely LOUD, and there is no volume switch either. And it goes off at the faintest movement. If it's on a table and you are walking too close to it, if the table senses your vibrations, Elmo pipes up loudly to invite you to play. We were hoping a volume switch would exist, at the very least. But nothing. Its voice is BOOMING. More upsetting though, is that we ordered it from this seller here on Amazon instead of buying it at a store, because it was cheaper than the one at Target. But when it arrived, we noticed instantly that we got a dud. When Elmo says to our son \"Can you help Elmo find Big Bird? Where is Big Bird?\" and he opens up the correct door to see Big Bird's face sitting there, Elmo says to him \"Noooo... you found ERNIE!\" and then the voice of Ernie says \"HI THERE!\", or whatever it says. You get the idea. When Elmo says \"Can you tell Elmo who is behind door number three?\" and he opens it and it's Abby Cadabby, you suddenly hear cookie monster's voice shout \"HELLOOOO!!!\" and Elmo says \"YOU found COOKIE MONSTER!\". And so on. The characters are wrong about 80 percent of the time, even when my son gets the answers right. The one he played with at the Target when he first saw this toy never did this. So clearly, we got a dud. We are going to return this one, and go buy it at Target (for more money, but at least we can test it out a few times to make sure we get one that actually works right). My poor son is so confused! He's almost two, and he really gets frustrated when he gets the answer right and Elmo says he was wrong. Not to mention when he hears the wrong character's voices emerge from the character behind the door almost every time. He ended up throwing the toy and crying. So sometimes you are better off paying a few dollars more to get a product from a store that you can investigate and test out yourself before paying. Lesson learned.**********************************Original Review:  We saw this while at a Target shopping for holiday gifts recently. I handed it to our toddler (21 months old) while he sat in the seat of the shopping cart. He became addicted to playing with it, feverishly pulling the lever over and over again to try to find the characters. It reminded me of watching the little old ladies at the local Casino slot machines for hours on end. He couldn't get enough of it. At one point we tried to take it from him, because we weren't going to buy it. But he went ballistic. So we handed it back to him and finished our shopping in peace. He played with it for so long and so hard that he fell asleep in the cart! It wore him out! We put it back on the shelf and added it to the Amazon wishlist of presents he will get for Christmas from Santa. ;)He later saw one at a friend's house while on a playdate, and didn't want to leave without it. It's insane, how much he loves this toy. We can't wait for him to open his very own on Christmas morning!", "categories": ["Toys & Games", "Learning & Education", "Early Development Toys"], "coreclasses": [["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Nutrition Bars"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Protein"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Post-Workout & Recovery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Amino Acids"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Stationery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Gift Wrapping Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Health Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Mirrors"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Hair Coloring Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Nail Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Makeup Brushes & Tools"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Nails"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Makeup Sets"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories"], ["Beauty", "Makeup"], ["Beauty", "Bath & Body"], ["Beauty"]]}

{"asin": "B0093162QS", "reviewText": "I had purchasedPhilips Hf3470 Wake-up Light,  Whitein the past, didn't like it and eventually returned it. This new light is much better. I like it and use it regularly.Two important points of comparison:First, this light has 4 brightness settings for the clock display. That means you can set it so that you can read the clock even when the light is on, or you can set it to be dim and not glow very much when it's dark.Second, this light can be used as a bedside lamp. It doesn't get hot. And you can control the lamp brightness separately from the wake-up light brightness. That is - you can use the lamp at brightness 10 for reading in bed, but when the wake-up light comes on it will still go up to 20. (I know this seems like an obvious behavior, but model HF3470 surprisingly did not do this.)The alarm sounds are the same, you can choose bird sounds or a peaceful music alarm. I find that the alarm sounds are really gentle - almost too gentle. If I don't get up the first time and press snooze instead, when the alarm rings again after the snooze, it is so peaceful that it pretty much soothes me back to sleep. Normally though I do wake up the first time (the light helps me wake).Only complaint is that the buttons are close together and don't have much texture or shape distinction. E.g. 'decrease brightness', 'turn on lamp', and 'increase brightness' are three nearly identical buttons right next to each other. When it's dark, it's hard to press the button you want on the first try.I do like the touch controls though (those are used for navigating menu and setting the clock and alarm time).", "categories": ["Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Alternative Medicine"], "coreclasses": [["Home & Kitchen", "Bedding", "Bedding Accessories"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Bedding"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Bath", "Bathroom Accessories"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Bath", "Towels"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Furniture", "Bedroom Furniture"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Furniture", "Home Office Furniture"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Furniture", "Living Room Furniture"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Furniture"], ["Home & Kitchen"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Household Supplies", "Household Cleaning"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Household Supplies", "Household Batteries"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Household Supplies", "Cleaning Tools"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Household Supplies", "Paper & Plastic"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Household Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Feminine Care"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Sleep & Snoring"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Health Care"]]}

{"asin": "B004XPIPRS", "reviewText": "I love \"Monster High.\" It's cute, and it sends a good message to girls. The dolls are lovely and unique.I just wanted a basic Cleo doll, so I thought this one would be perfect. Her hair is incredibly soft (though the tinsel kind of fell apart right away, so I spent a couple of hours cutting it out of her hair). It didn't need to be washed extensively, like some other dolls. Her pajamas are cute with the linen wrappings theme, and the eye mask has the Eye of Horus design over the eyes. The only part of her outfit I didn't like were the slippers--one of them (the right one, I think) was actually 1 - 2 millimeters too small. I realize that doesn't sound like much, but that's enough to make it difficult to slide the shoe on. They still will go on, but it's still a pain. It's a shame because they're actually pretty cute! They are little, fuzzy creatures with a cute grin, and their tongues are sticking out to the side.Her face up is softer than other Cleo dolls, but her eyes are still somewhat cold (as her image is still the mean girl, but not as much as she had been). Her eyes are a bit more narrow than previous dolls, as if she'd be objectively observing the other girls. It's kind of cute and makes the character seem quirky (since I don't think she's ever been to a real slumber party). To add to her characterization, she carries a nightlight with her--as stated in her original diary, she's afraid of the dark.The doll herself feels much sturdier than even my original, basic doll. The only catch is that her knee joints are weak and don't support the weight of her torso. Other than that, she's excellent. The legs are much more solid (and don't have any \"cracks\"), and the body just feels more substantial. I would highly recommend this doll to any \"Monster High\" fan.", "categories": ["Toys & Games", "Dolls & Accessories", "Dolls"], "coreclasses": [["Beauty", "Makeup", "Face"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Eyes"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Makeup Sets"], ["Beauty", "Makeup"], ["Beauty", "Hair Care"], ["Beauty", "Skin Care", "Face"], ["Beauty", "Skin Care", "Eyes"], ["Beauty", "Skin Care", "Sets & Kits"], ["Beauty", "Skin Care"], ["Beauty"], ["Toys & Games", "Dolls & Accessories", "Dolls"], ["Toys & Games", "Dolls & Accessories"], ["Toys & Games", "Grown-Up Toys", "Action & Toy Figures"], ["Toys & Games", "Grown-Up Toys", "Novelty & Gag Toys"], ["Toys & Games", "Grown-Up Toys", "Puzzles"], ["Toys & Games", "Grown-Up Toys"], ["Toys & Games", "Novelty & Gag Toys", "Miniatures"], ["Toys & Games", "Novelty & Gag Toys", "Novelty Games"], ["Toys & Games", "Novelty & Gag Toys", "Light-Up Toys"], ["Toys & Games", "Novelty & Gag Toys"]]}

{"asin": "B001BJLGZC", "reviewText": "A long, long time ago, when I was fresh out of college, my cousin sold Remington shavers and got me one for insider price. It was the old-fashioned straight-line kind. I tried it once and it irritated my skin so much that I never tried it again. I've stuck with sensitive-skin products like Edge and the various generations of Gillette multiblade hand razors since.When I read about this new Remington, with its Teflon coating, I decided to try electric shaving again. I was a little hesitant at first, but when the Remington got here I decided to go for it. First of all, it's a good size and weight for my hand, which is maybe a little larger than normal. It balances well and so it's easy to control its movement.Surprisingly, the shaver came charged for 60 minutes of use (even though they tell you to charge it for 24 hours before using). I really like the LCD readout that shows you how many minutes of charge are left.I have to admit I was a little nervous about putting it to my face, after the bad experience from decades ago. I took my first shave very gently and wasn't concerned with how close a shave I could get. This really helped me get a feel for how to move the rotary blades around my face and neck. Two days later I tried it again, and this time I tried to go for a gentle but close shave. I got a better feel for the circular motion and found that I didn't have to press nearly as hard as I thought to get a decent shave. It helped a lot to do as they advised: pull your skin tight as you move along so that your hairs stand up as much as possible.Bottom line: By my third try I got a good close shave and only the slightest irritation--and that was around the moustache area where it is indeed much more difficult to maneuver. I have to agree with other posters here that this is one area that needs improvement. The Teflon seems to make the shave palatable even for my sensitive skin. I felt no hair pulling at all and a fairly smooth ride across my face. I still have a ways to go in my \"technique\" to get a quick, smooth shave, but I really think this newfangled gadget is going to do the trick.Updated March 23, 2009: After a few more weeks, I got tired of using this and went back to my trusty old manual razor. Then about a month after that, I ran out of shaving cream and pulled out the Remington. I kind of liked the shave, so I tried it again a couple days later. Went well again. I started using it regularly. The only negative I felt was that the blades kind of dragged over my face, even after I dried my face thoroughly after a shower. So I ordered the Remington preshave powder stick thingy and now the razor just glides over my face and gives me a perfect shave every time. No irritation. Highly recommended, especially with the preshave.", "categories": ["Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Shaving & Hair Removal"], "coreclasses": [["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Nutrition Bars"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Protein"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Post-Workout & Recovery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Amino Acids"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Stationery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Gift Wrapping Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Health Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Mirrors"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Hair Coloring Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Nail Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Makeup Brushes & Tools"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Nails"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Makeup Sets"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories"], ["Beauty", "Makeup"], ["Beauty", "Bath & Body"], ["Beauty"]]}

I've asked all my friends about their Dysons and found you either loved it or hated it.  A few of them had problems with the suction on their Dyson.  One even told me that their vacuum repair guy loves Dysons due to how many he sees come through his shop.  I have a Hoover WindTunnel Canister vacuum that I bought in May of 2008 and I was dying to replace it.Hoover WindTunnel Canister Vacuum, Bagless, S3755But with the hefty price tag on the Dyson I was hesitant to buy without trying it first.When my neighbor bought the latest Dyson vacuum I jumped on the chance to try it out.  I vacuumed half of my house with my vacuum first as I normally would and then used the Dyson over those same spots to see what was missed.  A small amount was picked up in the Dyson.  I then vacuumed the other half of my house with the Dyson first.  I LOVED the handeling of the Dyson!  The new ball feature made it so easy to maneuver and it was very light.  But I noticed right away that the Dyson wouldn't pick up large items.  I have two cats and three kids so I have all sorts of things on my carpet.  The Dyson would not pick up the pieces of carpet that flake off the cats' scratching post.  Nor would it pick up the Cheerios left by my toddler.  I could go over the same area multiple times and it still wouldn't pick up the large pieces.  I was pretty bummed.

{"asin": "B005HIH7YM", "reviewText": "My hair takes forever to wash and condition. It is thick, curly, dried out and downright unruly.  Washing it would just make it more tangled than it was to begin with, and then I would have to use massive amounts of conditioner and time to untangle it. I was searching for a new shampoo when I came across this product on Amazon. It was about $6, and I usually spend double that amount on shampoo alone, so I figured I'll give it a try. Well, my first experience with the cleansing conditioner was a bit disappointing since I did not know that it would not really lather. Since it is a cleansing conditioner, it is only 1/4 cleanser. (Feel free to correct me if I am wrong). The rest moisturizes your hair. Therefore, it won't lather up like normal shampoos. Some tips for using this cleansing conditioner are:Use a clarifying or regular shampoo first if your hair is full of styling product (In my experience, the cleansing conditioner is not strong enough to take these products out of your hair)Make sure you really soak your hair in water before you apply the product (Water helps the product to lather up a bit)Find out what number of pumps work best for you (If  you have short hair, 8-10 pumps may be enough. I need about 16-18 pumps for my hair, but it is thick and about 5 inches past my shoulders).Once the product is lathered, I leave it on for a minute or two and then add a splash of water. This helps when I go to detangle my hair, which is a breeze now with this product. After detangling, I simply rinse it out with cool water for another minute (some people may need to rinse longer since people with finer hair may notice a feeling of residue). The scent to me is delicious, a bit like coconut and vanilla mixed together. Scents usually bother me, but this one does not. The only thing that I wish I could change is the pump bottle, because I use so many pumps.

{"asin": "B000XPS3QU", "reviewText": "We had been going to get juice at the local health food store and it was very expensive.  Like around $7.00 for a 16 oz cup.  Plus, their juicer was often in need of repair and not even functioning.So we decided to get a juicer of our own.  Did not want the centrifugal/grater/shredder type because the quality of the juice would be affected.  Also we were adverse to using a juicer made of plastic due to recent research showing leaching problems with some types of plastic.  So that really narrowed the selection to two stainless steel juicers:  the Super Angel and the Norwalk.Money was no issue in our decision, so we were looking for something easy to clean that would last and produce high-quality juice efficiently.  The reviews we read suggested the Super Angel was easy to clean and almost as efficient as the Norwalk for juice extraction.  Plus it is much smaller and lighter than the Norwalk.We got our juicer and discovered that it is trivial to clean (takes maybe six minutes), is 100% stainless steel, is quiet in operation, produces great-tasting, high-quality pulp-free juice, and ejects pulp that is very, very dry.There is zero pulp in the juice we are getting.  We left the skin on everything and it was no problem.  We tried carrots, apples, pineapples, ginger, limes, cucumbers, celery, parsley, spinach.  All worked great.  There was a bit of foam in the chute from the softer fruits, but one of the plungers they sent had a seal on it and it sent the foam right down the chute, no problem.They sent a very nice stainless steel juice-catching container, plus a couple of pretty nice plastic ones.  Also a brush that makes cleanup very simple.  I might order some extra brushes for the future, since I can see this thing is going to last a long time.  Glad to see the 10 year warranty on this machine.

Wasn't quite sure we bought into the hype over the Dyson, but we are very, very pleased.  We have two dogs and are constantly in and out of the house working in the yard and here are the differences we noticed:1)  The Dyson picks up much more dirt than the Hoover - carpets and tile floor feel cleaner after we are done and we have cut down our vacuuming from twice a week to once a week.2)  The house smells better.  When the dog hair sits in the Hoover for a few days and we use the vacuum - it just stinks like rotting dog hair.  We empty the Dyson cup every time we finish and there is no offensive smell.3)  Used the Dyson right after we finished vacuuming with the Hoover.  We have carpet in four bedrooms and one great room and two 4' x 8' rugs in our dining room and tile in the kitchen and hallways.  We vacuumed with the Dyson twice in three days and picked up 3 full containers of dirt/hair.  Now when we vacuum, we pick up about half a cup each time.  Not only hair, but the fine dirt it picks up is incredible.4)  We used the Dyson in our 34' rv and it picked up almost a full cup of dirt, sand and hair - did a beautiful job.  The Hoover is in the garage - will probably donate it.5)  The accessory hose took a while to get used to but we are in the groove now.6)  Not one negative to say about the Dyson at this point - would recommend to anyone.", "categories": ["Home & Kitchen", "Vacuums & Floor Care", "Vacuums"], "coreclasses": [["Home & Kitchen", "Vacuums & Floor Care", "Vacuum Accessories"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Vacuums & Floor Care", "Carpet Cleaner Accessories"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Vacuums & Floor Care", "Steam Cleaners & Accessories"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Vacuums & Floor Care"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Kitchen & Dining", "Small Appliance Parts & Accessories"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Kitchen & Dining", "Small Appliances"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Kitchen & Dining", "Wine Accessories"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Kitchen & Dining", "Kitchen Utensils & Gadgets"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Kitchen & Dining"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Bath", "Bath Rugs"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Bath", "Bathroom Accessories"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Bath", "Towels"], ["Home & Kitchen"], ["Toys & Games", "Dolls & Accessories", "Doll Accessories"], ["Toys & Games", "Dolls & Accessories"], ["Toys & Games", "Electronics for Kids", "Systems & Accessories"], ["Toys & Games", "Electronics for Kids", "Personal Video Players & Accessories"], ["Toys & Games", "Electronics for Kids", "Electronic Pets"], ["Toys & Games", "Electronics for Kids", "Electronic Toys"], ["Toys & Games", "Hobbies"]]}
{"asin": "B00BU7F6VA", "reviewText": "I have had many different brands of hand held cordless vacuums over the years. The only problem that I have ever experience using one of this devices is back pain because you must bend to get at the crumbs, etc. This Eureka Rapid Clean 2 in 1 unit has eliminated that problem yet still gives me the option to vacuum out my car using only  the handheld device.The unit comes with a compact charging station and charges quickly and easily. It can also be mounted on a wall and the hardware for this type of installation is included in the box. It is, however, not necessary to attach it to a wall and can be place in any small location near an electric outlet. It is also comforting to know that in the event of a power failure, I will still have a device to keep debris off my floors.I have three cats and it does a remarkable job of picking up bits of food strewn by them about their feeding area, crumbs in the kitchen and even has an attachment to use on rugs.It is a bit noisy, but I have yet to find a vacuum of any type that is totally quiet. There are many uses for a cordless vac as most of us already know, but they all require bending. If you like a cordless vac and hate bending because of back issues or vertigo (yes, I have both problems), you will really appreciate this design.The topmost on off switch doesn't work anymore. The unit's suction no longer picks up cat litter on my bare bathroom tile floor. Now that I have used it for awhile, I find it harder and harder to empty the unit. I cannot recommend that anyone buy it.  When I first began using it, I posted a glowing review.

My favorite flavor has always been the cherry lozenges, but now the company is coming out with a wide variety of flavors and &#8220;styles&#8221; to suit every palate.  When I have a cold not much matters, even the flavor.  These QuickMelts are one alternative for those who can&#8217;t stand moving a lozenge around in their mouth for what seems a lifetime.I&#8217;ve always had some lozenges on hand and sworn that they have shortened up my colds.  No, I&#8217;ve still felt miserable, but the miserable factor has been shortened.  One thing I noticed on their website:  &#8220;Cold-EEZE lozenges have been clinically proven to shorten the duration of the common cold by almost half. The efficacy of our best selling lozenges is backed by double-blind placebo-controlled studies conducted at both the prestigious Cleveland Clinic and Dartmouth College.&#8221;This statement, along with my own experience with Cold-EEZE makes me feel a bit less tentative about taking the QuickMelts and more assured that they really works.  Sometimes I wondered if the thought that it shortened up my colds was all in my head right along with the cold.

{"asin": "B004PANDIC", "reviewText": "This flat iron does what it is supposed to do - it straightens your hair. It does a good job, but there is nothing amazing about it. It performs just as good as any other flat iron in the $30-40 range. The T3 doesn't have any qualities or abilities that would make it worth the extra money when compared to other irons.It does glide smoothly, but I get that same performance from other irons as well. I have several flat irons, and my daughters have gone through several as well, so I have tried probably 15 different irons in the past several years. Typically, any iron that has tourmaline or ceramic plates is going to be smoother on your hair. Having the temperature dial and high heat capability is a nice feature to look for, which this T3 has. Some of the cheaper irons in the $20 range do not get as hot. A lot of us need the higher temperature to really get our hair straight. This one goes to 410 degrees. I have another one that goes to 430 degrees and I get the same amount of straightening from both. Anything above 400 degrees works well for me.It heats up quickly and cools down quickly. A little purple light will blink until it hits your desired temperature, and then will become a steady light.This one really looks nice as far as the color - black with really neat multi colored glitter. It has small rubber treads for grip, although I wish they were higher up towards the end of the iron so that you could use them when clamping the hair tighter.One thing I am not sure if I like, is where the power switch and temperature dial are located - inside, next to the iron plate. It makes it nice so that you aren't accidentally hitting them while using the iron, but you also have to be careful when turning it off or adjusting the heat so that you don't burn yourself.The cord is thick and looks/feels heavy duty. It doesn't seem to crink or twist up, even if you wrap your cord around your iron after use, like I do. The cord turns on the iron too, so it won't tangle.Overall, this T3 flat iron is a nice choice, but you can get the same results and quality from a cheaper unit. It just depends how much you want to spend. I gave it 4 stars. I knocked one off for pricing because I do not feel like it offers anything special for the extra cost, aside from the sparkles :)", "categories": ["Beauty", "Hair Care", "Styling Tools"], "coreclasses": [["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Nutrition Bars"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Protein"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Post-Workout & Recovery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Amino Acids"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Stationery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Gift Wrapping Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Health Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Mirrors"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Hair Coloring Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Nail Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Makeup Brushes & Tools"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Nails"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Makeup Sets"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories"], ["Beauty", "Makeup"], ["Beauty", "Bath & Body"], ["Beauty"]]}

Powder settles as it is handled and shipped and the scoop tends to move toward the bottom. The scoop is small, so using one scoop doesn't seem like much soap, even if it is concentrated. I generally use a heaping scoop, especially for a large load. I would not expect to get 70 loads out of the container.One of the reasons I switched to liquid detergents is that I almost always wash in cold water and some soaps do not dissolve well in cold water. I put a scoop of this detergent in the bottom of the wash tub and started the water before adding clothes. The detergent dissolved quickly and completely in cold water.The Free and Clear version has no scent and doesn't leave any scent or soapy smell on clothes.How does it clean? It seems to work well on typical laundry. So far it hasn't faced any major challenges, but it gets our regular laundry clean and fresh.I still prefer the liquid soap, but that is a personal preference more than anything.

{"asin": "B000NL0T1G", "reviewText": "Short Summary:  This is my first experience with a DE safety razor and I can say without a doubt that I am never going back to disposable cartridges (In my case, the Gillette Sensor and Fusion series).  Performance and workmanship of this razor is top-notch.  Based on several other web reviews (which i also support), the 180 is a very forgiving razor and would be a perfect start to anyone just stepping into the wetshaving experience.I wanted to have 3 months of usage/experience in order to give this razor an honest shakedown because I have thin, sparse, fairly slow-growing facial hair - I shave maybe once every 2 or 3 days.Performance and Feel:  The 180 is very well-balanced and has a certain heft that allows the razor/blade to do all the work without you applying any pressure.  It took me a few shaves to get use to just guiding the razor where to go instead of pulling it all over my face.  In all honesty, the learning curve is very short, but take your time and you will be rewarded with an extremely close shave.Workmanship:  Metal plating was meticulously done and has a very high quality appearance.  After 3 months of usage, there are no signs of degradation or chipping/flaking that I read about in one of the other reviews.  I will still look out for any workmanship failures and will update this review if i encounter any.  At this moment, it looks like this razor is going to last several years.Other variables that directly/indirectly impact my Merkur 180 review:  Based on several recommendations, I purchased a sampler pack of blades.  I settled on the Astra Super Premium Platinum blade due to its great performance and extremely low cost...100 blades for $10 is ridiculously unreal.  I also ditched the cheap foam/gel can stuff and went with Cremo Shave Cream.  I will admit that I face lather (not brush lathering...yet) but the smooth feel, high lubricity, and lack of post-shave skin irritation from this shave cream puts it several levels above mainstream products.", "categories": ["Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Shaving & Hair Removal"], "coreclasses": [["Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Shaving & Hair Removal"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Feminine Care"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Eye Care"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Ear Care"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Therapeutic Skin Care"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Stimulants"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Stress Reduction"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Health Care"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Household Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care"], ["Beauty", "Hair Care", "Hair & Scalp Treatments"], ["Beauty", "Hair Care", "Styling Products"], ["Beauty", "Hair Care", "Hair Loss Products"], ["Beauty", "Hair Care", "Styling Tools"], ["Beauty", "Hair Care"], ["Beauty", "Skin Care", "Face"], ["Beauty", "Skin Care", "Sets & Kits"], ["Beauty", "Skin Care", "Sun"], ["Beauty", "Skin Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories"], ["Beauty"]]}

No books on infused water use such a device, and in fact this inhibits flavor distribution by keeping the stuff bound together rather than letting it move about in the pitcher freely so the water and flavor enhancers can interact.You can buy a plastic pitcher (I recommend two) with a flip open covered lid so you can pour easily without the flavor enhancers going into your glass, but in reality there's always a piece of lemon floating on top that I just put my clean fingertip or a clean spoon on as I pour from an open pitcher (because I like to use glass pitchers rather than plastic).No need for this, but if you want something else to have to store and clean and to complicate the process unnecessarily, go for it.", "categories": ["Home & Kitchen", "Kitchen & Dining", "Dining & Entertaining"], "coreclasses": [["Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Body Art"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Ear Care"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Feminine Care"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Foot Care"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Household Supplies", "Household Cleaning"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Household Supplies", "Cleaning Tools"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Household Supplies", "Paper & Plastic"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Household Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Alternative Medicine"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Health Care"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Storage & Organization", "Home Storage Hooks"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Storage & Organization", "Racks, Shelves & Drawers"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Storage & Organization"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Kitchen & Dining", "Storage & Organization"]]}

Don't expect it to chop evenly as it's just a spinning blade at the bottom of the cup and what's at the top may not get chopped enough unless you keep running it, which then purees some of what's on the bottom. The picture is somewhat misleading as to what results you can expect. None of my ingredients come out looking quite like that. I think that is a 'before' shot, before turning it on that is.Just throw it in the dishwasher afterwards (except the base unit of course).

{"asin": "B000VNO29G", "reviewText": "Based on reading the reviews that explained how it worked, I was able to set the timers without even reading the instructions.I have to say that when I did have a problem with how it worked and went to read the instructions they were useless to me.Better to read the reviewers that explain how it works.My one thing that took a bit to figure out and some frustration because the instructions didn't help was once the 3 timers stopped.I like using all 3 at once. That was why I bought it - this way I am giving warning at different stages of when something is needed to be done that I am working on.However, once all 3 had been stopped - then they were all Blinking 0 - trying to get them back to the times so I could continue again, ended up clearing them and needing to reset all 3 timers again.I have with trial and error found that one must - when they are all Blinking 0 - then hit the clear button - 1x for each line/timer. and then can hit the start/stop button 1x - which then brings the time that was set back on each one, ready to use again.I don't see why it couldn't just set itself back to the time without having to do all that 'clearing' which seems counter to the goal of still having the time - be careful when you do hit the clear, because if hit in the wrong order or too many times will clear everything and the times will all have to be reset - which woudn't be a danger if they had made it to be used only when one wanted to clear, but that is not how it was made to work unfortunately.I was most unsure about buying this because of the complaints that the timer beep was very loud. I am not a noise person, and I even have my home phone ringer off because I got so many telemarketers and wrong numbers and I didn't want to hear it ringing until the answering machine picked up.I have not had a problem with this timer's ringer. The goal is to hear it wherever I am, close by or at the other side of the house - this it does well. But it doesn't bother me by the loudness though. I am happy with the volume. Loud yes, but for me not excessive.After about 2 weeks:It started making static type noise and stopped working. After a couple of times of just taking of the battery cover and replacing the same batteries - it started again but as soon as I started resetting the 1st timer, it died again with the same loud static/fizzy noise.I was going to replace the batteries, but when I went to replace the left one, it started making that static noise again; I rotated it and, still using the same batteries, I tried again. It came up and let me reset all 3 timers without dying.Not very reassuring though. I think there is something wrong with the left battery slot.Really frustrating how cheap things are made; ready to die at the drop of a hat.", "categories": ["Home & Kitchen", "Kitchen & Dining", "Kitchen Utensils & Gadgets"], "coreclasses": [["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Nutrition Bars"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Protein"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Post-Workout & Recovery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Amino Acids"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Stationery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Gift Wrapping Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Health Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Mirrors"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Hair Coloring Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Nail Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Makeup Brushes & Tools"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Nails"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Makeup Sets"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories"], ["Beauty", "Makeup"], ["Beauty", "Bath & Body"], ["Beauty"]]}

It's just too cost prohibitive ($1.25 a sheet) to use this for aimless doodling.So this isn't a casual toy -- use it like that for kids who just want to doodle with it, and like other reviewers have said, you'll use up all four included sheets within minutes and you'll have another piece of junk to throw in a closet.I know my son is too young for this now. I think unless money is no object, or your child is artistically inclined and capable of forming and executing a clear vision, a more sensible age to start this would be 7-9, rather than the 5 year starting age the manufacturer recommends. It has its merits as a \"special occasion\" toy, but not for everyday use.That being said, the light table is pretty good by itself for some things. I use lupes a lot at work, and I could see potential for looking at things from the outdoors on the table, backlit and through a lupe. That could be pretty interesting for a lot of kids.

As silly as this sounds, I'm frankly amazed how the fruit stays fresh as long as it is submerged in water.  As other reviewers state, it's important to refill your pitcher as you pour each glass so that the small amount of new water has time to be properly infused. Otherwise, if you wait until the pitcher is empty to refill the water, the water will need a few hours to become fruit flavored.I've only hand washed this so I can't comment on any issues with running it through a dish washer but since the pitcher consists of only 3 pieces I imagine that it wouldn't be difficult to run it through the DW (especially since it is considered DW safe).  I was hoping for a slightly bigger capacity pitcher, however, this pitcher fits perfectly in the shelf of my refrigerator door so I'm happy about that.I planned on also trying to throw a couple of tea bags into the center cylinder over night to see if it could be used as an iced tea pitcher (or better yet, a fruit infused iced tea masterpiece - Strawberry Ice Tea anyone?!) but the fruit-infused water has been so tasty that I didn't want to mess with it yet.I would give this 5 stars if the top of the pitcher wasn't as awkward to close.", "categories": ["Home & Kitchen", "Kitchen & Dining", "Dining & Entertaining"], "coreclasses": [["Home & Kitchen", "Kitchen & Dining", "Food Service Equipment & Supplies"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Kitchen & Dining", "Kitchen Utensils & Gadgets"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Kitchen & Dining", "Small Appliances"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Kitchen & Dining", "Small Appliance Parts & Accessories"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Kitchen & Dining"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Bath", "Bathroom Accessories"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Bath", "Towels"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Bath", "Bath Rugs"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Bath"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Storage & Organization", "Home Storage Hooks"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Storage & Organization", "Bathroom Storage & Organization"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Storage & Organization", "Laundry Storage & Organization"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Storage & Organization", "Racks, Shelves & Drawers"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Storage & Organization"], ["Home & Kitchen"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Household Supplies", "Household Cleaning"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Household Supplies", "Household Batteries"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Household Supplies", "Paper & Plastic"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Household Supplies", "Cleaning Tools"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Household Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Party Supplies"]]}

{"asin": "B008EYT1PO", "reviewText": "This is an attractive design that matches many of the espresso coffee makers, with its black base and bold glass shape. It looks great.Alas, it is very limited on tea-making. It is on a fixed time cycle at a fixed temperature. For tea bags, that's OK. The tea will generally be small leaf, often the \"fannings\" that are like tea dust and blended to release their full taste quickly -- a minute or so. They survive microwaving, hottish water, and oversteeping. This kettle will give as good a brew as you can expect from the ingredients. The brew will be assertive and unsubtle but fresh and full.Loose leaf teas are entirely different. They demand a narrow range of temperatures. Black teas are best for this machine. They require water that is at boiling point and a brewing time of 2-3 minutes. The Krups kettle does a pretty reasonable job with these. I tried an estate Assam, which can be very bitter if brewed too long. The Krups takes 4-6 minutes for a few cup-sized brew. The tea was pleasant and more than good enough. I also tried a higher grade Yunnan Gold Tips that was OK but not as full in flavor as the tea is when brewed at 212 degrees for 2 minutes. Using a very fine Temi was a bit of a waste; the overtones of flavor were lost.I then tested a good quality Young Hyson green tea that is fairly full but delicate. The result was not satisfying. The blacks withstand the zap but it was too much for the hyson and for a Jasmine pearl I also tried. The tea was bitter and flat. With oolongs that are more like black teas -- water just below boiling with a slightly longer brewing time of 3-4 minutes -- the result was better. I tested a Big Red Robe and basic Formosa leaf that were both fully acceptable, with a clean taste.The lack of temperature and time controls is a definite limitation. It means that this is an enhanced kettle not a real brewing device. I plan to use it for black teas and everyday smoky oolongs but not for green teas. I really do like the styling, though the basket and lid are awkward to handle and ensure correct fitting into the pot. It has the merit of not pouring boiling water directly onto the tea leaf but infusing the leaf in a way that keeps it aerated. But it's a compromise. The temperature/time issue is absolutely critical in making tea and the main reason that so many tea bag brew ups are so truly and irredeemably dreadful. The Krups compromise provides a better cup but not the best. I hesitate to recommend it but equally hesitate not to do so. The trade off is between form and function. If you don't drink a lot of tea the form is perhaps of more relevance than the function and makes it well worth buying.", "categories": ["Home & Kitchen", "Kitchen & Dining", "Small Appliances"], "coreclasses": [["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Nutrition Bars"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Protein"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Post-Workout & Recovery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Amino Acids"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Stationery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Gift Wrapping Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Health Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Mirrors"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Hair Coloring Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Nail Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Makeup Brushes & Tools"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Nails"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Makeup Sets"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories"], ["Beauty", "Makeup"], ["Beauty", "Bath & Body"], ["Beauty"]]}
{"asin": "B00IOD354I", "reviewText": "I have used a Dyson Ball for about 8 years, so that is what I compared this Samsung to as I tried it out.  I loved the idea of the detachable hand vacuum, which really drew me in to try this.:: Things I liked ::- Easy steering on carpet- The suction of the vacuum with and without the beater bar is great.  Not as good the Dyson, but better than a really cheap vacuum.- The detachable hand vac was convenient, especially for hard to reach areas like under beds and in the car- The handle is comfortable- The cord is easy to unwind & wind up, and it is a good length- Emptying & cleaning the dirt canisters are easy- Reclining the vacuum does not require a lever push; rather, you hold the front of the vacuum down with your foot and pull back on the handle with your hand.  I both liked and disliked this feature, because it was easy, just not what I'm used to.- The rubber bumpers kept my walls & moulding from damage.:: Things I did not like ::- Steering on my hardwood & tile requires more effort.  Pushing this on my thick (1.5\" pile) berber area rug was very difficult; it feels like it loses all of it's self-propelled capabilities on this particular carpet.- I have a gel-filled floor mat in my kitchen, and this vacuum can barely move when I tried to use it to clean it (beater bar was off).  My Dyson has no problem with it, however.- Moving this around when the motor is off is much more difficult than it should be!  I can't tell if it's the rubber on the wheels or if the wheels actually won't turn easily without the motor.- The suction on the detachable hand vac was weaker than I hoped for, much weaker than the hose on the Dyson Ball.  It wouldn't suck up small pieces of paper or candy wrappers easily, due to the small opening at the end.  I also found some of the debris I had sucked up was actually stuck at the entrance to the canister, so it hadn't even made it into the canister and had blocked the airflow in the process.- Despite it's small profile, this vacuum is not lightweight.- The end of my daughter's bathrobe tie caught on the beater bar, which promptly shut off.  I was worried I had broken it, but thankfully the manual instructed me to push the reset button, which worked.  Even though it was fixable, it was not a lot of the tie to get caught, so I found it odd that the beater bar shut off so easily.- The buttons for power, shutting off the beater bar, and detaching the hand vac are all in different locations and I felt like I was searching for the correct button each time I needed one.By the time I was finished doing the floors of my house with this, I felt like it had been more of a chore than what I'm used to with my Dyson Ball.  With the extra effort needed to push it on some of my flooring, plus lower suction power than what I'm used to with the Dyson, I'm not sure I'd recommend this more than a Dyson, especially at this price.  If, however, the Samsung is being considered against a cheap vacuum, it certainly is a step up in both performance and abilities.", "categories": ["Home & Kitchen", "Vacuums & Floor Care", "Vacuums"], "coreclasses": [["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Nutrition Bars"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Protein"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Post-Workout & Recovery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Amino Acids"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Stationery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Gift Wrapping Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Health Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Mirrors"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Hair Coloring Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Nail Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Makeup Brushes & Tools"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Nails"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Makeup Sets"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories"], ["Beauty", "Makeup"], ["Beauty", "Bath & Body"], ["Beauty"]]}

{"asin": "B0083VCXQM", "reviewText": "I did a lot of research on toasters here at Amazon before deciding on this one.  Reviews are all over the board for this and every other toaster.  The biggest selling point for me was the generous size of the slots.  I wanted to be able to put my organic seed bread in without having to bend it or shove it in.  I also wanted to be able to fit a bagel in without shaving off some of it first.  Everything I've put in this toaster has fit easily.  The bagel setting does a wonderful job of toasting the cut side while warming the outside.  The defrost setting is perfect for toaster strudels.  It defrosts them, then toasts them so when they come out they are done throughout, and not still hard and cold in the middle.  English muffins can finally be toasted in one pass instead of two or more.  A complaint people seem to have about this toaster is that it gets too hot...it's an appliance so yes, it does get rather warm, but I've never had an urge to fondle my toaster while it is toasting, so there is no reason for the warmth to bother me.  It also has a high-lift lever so you never need to touch the toaster to remove your item.  The only drawback to this toaster for me is the settings dial, which goes from 1-6.  I like lightly browned toast and to achieve that I have to go to 4.5, so the lower settings are useless to me.  If you like dark toast, this will not do the job, but if you're fine with light to medium toast, this is a great choice.  If this toaster lasts more than a year, I will up the rating to 5 stars.

{"asin": "B00AYARK2C", "reviewText": "I have been using Perfective Ceuticals eye therapy cream for three weeks to improve the appearnace of my skin under the eyes. Overall, I like it. I see some improvement, although it is only a relative improvement not total obliteration of the fine lines and wrinkles.I am attaching a photo of the cream in my hand (photo can be located by following 'customer photos' link under the main photo). The cream is white and totally unscented. The delivery system is a pump, which delivers a small amount of cream and is easy to control not to use too much. Direction say to use just a small drop under each eye, twice a day. The second photo show a container next to a pen for size reference. With the cap off the container is 3.75\" tall from the bottom to the top of the pump.The cream spreads nicely, leaves no shine so I can put it on and go out without worrying about tell-tell shine under my eyes. I am applying the cream twice a day in the morning and in the evening. It is totally odorless which is very important to me as I prefer fragrance free cosmetics.I received this cream for testing and evaluation from the manufacture. Having this direct line to them I wrote to them asking the details about the \"growth\" factor mentioned in the name. I wanted to understand better what this was and whether it could have any negative effects by penetrating my skin.I received an explanation that Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) is a protein with 53 amino acids. It is very large in size and not able to penetrate into the skin topically. It is approved for cosmetic use by the FDA and there is no evidence topically applied EGF causes skin cancer cells to multiply faster.EGF works by reducing the length and depth of fine lines. Matrixyl (Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4) helps reduce eye puffiness by strengthening the elasticity of the eye skin area. Argireline (Acetyl Hexapeptide) helps under eye wrinkles and crow's feet wrinkles to become more resilient to the aging process. The cream also contains Retinol and Ginseng Extract to de-saturate dark circles.Complete list of ingredients:Water (Aqua), Butylene Glycol, Glycerin, Ginseng Extract, Polyquaternium-51, Sodium Hyaluronate, Raffinose, Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), Hydroxyproline, Argireline (Acetyl Hexapeptide), Vitamin E Acetate, Retinol, Benzyl Alcohol, Stearyl Alcohol, Cholesteryl Hydroxystearate, Pentaerythrityl Tetraoctanoate, Olive Squalane, Propylene Glycol Stearate, Dimethicone, Matrixyl (Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4), Paeonia Albiflora Root Extract, EthylparabenIn response to my inquiry the manufacture also sent me an article published in a Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (\"Human growth factor and cytokine skin cream for facial skin rejuvenation as assessed by 3D in vivo optical skin imaging\" Journal of Drugs in Dermatology, Oct, 2007 by Michael H. Gold, Mitchel P. Goldman, Julie Biron) which describes the results of placebo-controlled study investigating the effects of skin cream containing EFG.Note: I checked that you can find this article by Googling for its name if you want to read the entire study.In this study the skin was analyzed clinically and with with imaging hardware. This study found that skin surface roughness decreased between 10% and 18% after 2 months of twice-daily application of the cream. I think this article sets up a realistic expectation of the type of improvement one might expect. It works, but do not expect miracles.Ali Julia review", "categories": ["Beauty", "Skin Care", "Eyes"], "coreclasses": [["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Nutrition Bars"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Protein"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Post-Workout & Recovery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Amino Acids"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Stationery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Gift Wrapping Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Health Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Mirrors"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Hair Coloring Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Nail Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Makeup Brushes & Tools"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Nails"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Makeup Sets"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories"], ["Beauty", "Makeup"], ["Beauty", "Bath & Body"], ["Beauty"]]}

{"asin": "B0038KRVGA", "reviewText": "This juicer is easy to use, easy to clean up (almost every part is dishwasher safe), and packs a punch. While it's not some giant monster unit that will take over your entire counter, it's still an appliance- around somewhere in between the size of a blender and food processor.My husband and I just took out of the box (it was mostly assembled in the box- it comes with the base plus about four additional parts that snap into place), quickly cleaned the machine, plugged it in, and away we went.We threw in a handful of grapes, a whole apple, four carrots, two pieces of celery, and a small handful of spinach (what we had in the fridge at the moment). Everything was put into the juicer whole (except for the apple, which was the size of a softball and had to be cut in half) and fit fine. Within a flip of a switch and an instant to work, my husband had a HUGE tumbler of a frothy, cold, creamy fruit and veggie smoothie. And it actually tastes really good. I've never been a big fan of juicing, (I drink a lot of tea) but I do have to admit, there's a serious refreshing and crisp quality to a fresh glass of juice. It's definitely better than the stuff you get from the store. And as long as you have more glasses to put under the spout, you can continue juicing as long as you like.Just a few small complaints- food can pop up from the shoot when the machine is running,  and it's a little messy when disassembling for cleanup. But that's to be expected.This is NOT a machine that grinds up seeds and pits and the typically \"unedible\" bits of fruit and veggies, just so you know. Most of the pulp from the fruits and veggies were in the receptacle (the long black piece on the side of the unit) but a few bits ended up in the bowl, easily cleaned out with a quick rinse. There was very little \"grainy\" pulp in the smoothie we made. I tend to dislike pulpy drinks and I didn't notice much pulp at all- the smoothie was incredibly smooth without being thin or watery.The pulp, which can be used in recipes and baking, was a little moist, but not drippy, so the juicer did a very nice job of extracting the juice from the fruits and veggies.So, in about three minutes, with a handful of stuff we already had in our fridge, we made a delicious smoothie. And cleanup was just as fast and easy as making the juice.  I'm really very impressed with this machine. I'm kind of a beverage gadget queen, and I've had everything from smoothie machines to blenders to shaved ice makers and this is the most impressed I've been with any of them. Never thought a juicer might inspire me to start experimenting more in my kitchen, but it has.The recipe book is a little uninspired (mainly a stapled together booklet with some \"intro to juicing\" suggestions in it), but it's a good start. I think the key is to just try different things and see what you like.If you're looking for a new way to make some nice treats for your family, this may be your gadget. I'm glad my husband was interested in this gadget, it may actually the one I wind up using regularly, and for the long haul.", "categories": ["Home & Kitchen", "Kitchen & Dining", "Small Appliances"], "coreclasses": [["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Nutrition Bars"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Protein"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Post-Workout & Recovery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Amino Acids"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Stationery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Gift Wrapping Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Health Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Mirrors"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Hair Coloring Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Nail Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Makeup Brushes & Tools"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Nails"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Makeup Sets"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories"], ["Beauty", "Makeup"], ["Beauty", "Bath & Body"], ["Beauty"]]}

Leaving oils on the counter next to the stove will degrade them. Just keep it in the cabinet or pantry where it's dark and cool to yield best result.I also recommend this brand's Arbequina formula for salad and crudites. It's a bit lighter and loftier.I keep about 7 different quality oils for cooking and baking in my pantry (grapeseed stays in fridge). All are in glass vessels and serve their specific purpose for specialized cooking. This is an excellent all around product, American produced, at an extremely fair price.

Putting Dual Loc on the command strip means that you can hide the pull tab.  Dual loc is basically industrial velcro which doesn't slip.  You can now use it to hang pictures.

{"asin": "B000RJGB5C", "reviewText": "I had always been intrigued by the neti pot, especially since my sister swore by it. But I found the neti pot extremely difficult to use. With the neti pot, you have to tilt your head a certain way, which I couldn't always do. And when I could, it was usually in an uncomfortable position, putting strain on my neck which I already have problems with.I heard about the sinus rinse after I had purchased the neti pot, and it looked a lot easier, so I gave it a shot. I wish I had just purchased this instead because it was so much easier! No tilting your head in funny angles. No struggling to get the water to flow properly. This works! All you have to do is bend over the sink and that's it. I even got one for my mom since she was having some of the same problems with the neti pot and she likes this much better too.The only reason I gave this four stars is because this is, by no means, a miracle product, at least not for me. I still get daily congestion. But it does help some and I think if I use this more often, I might get some relief.A few tips for new users...Make sure you SHAKE the bottle to get the salt mixed. If you forget, IT WILL BURN! (Think the almost drowning in a pool sensation) Also, there are times whenever I'm so congested that it'll only go through one side. If this is the case, I don't try to force it to go through the side it won't go though. Then it just gets all in my ears.Also, it says you can microwave the bottle, but I don't like to do that. Warm water from the tap seems to work just fine. (EDIT 12/30/12: I don't do this anymore. I now use purified bottle water and put it into the microwave for 20 seconds. I was told you really shouldn't use tap water because it's not filtered. Since I have switched to bottle water, I think it works better!)Oh, and one more thing...I don't know if this comes with all of them, but when I got mine, it had a solution that was premixed already in the bottle to get you started. I'd suggest pouring that out and letting the bottle air out for a day or so, because the solution it comes with stinks. (And I had to smell it all day since I shot it up my nose...) I don't know what was in it, but the salt packets that come with it do not have that smell.(EDIT 12/30/12: One issue I have had is that it is hard to clean on the inside. I sometimes use an old toothbrush to scrub out the inside of it, but the tube is difficult to clean. Anyone have any tips on how to clean it out properly?

{"asin": "B003F2T0M4", "reviewText": "I normally use a marcel curling iron (no spring) and leave out the last inch or two of hair so that the curls fall more naturally (kind of like the \"beach\" look with loose waves/curls).  Therefore, I thought this \"You Curl\" curling iron would be great for me.  For those who expect to curl your hair completely to the ends, this is not for you.I think some people may not be using it correctly when they mentioned about wrapping your hair around certain parts of it depending on the size of curl you want.  I hold the iron with handle in air and end pointing down and start wrapping hair at thick end by handle and then kind of spiral the hair onto the iron down it (not all in one spot).  My hair is about 3 inches below my shoulders, but it is in long layers, and I don't curl underneath --- I leave that straight to lengthen the appearance.I found that I can't use as large sections of hair as I do with the marcel iron.  If I try that, I have to recurl the bottom half of the section. Therefore, it takes me much longer to use the You Curl, since I have to curl smaller sections of hair.  Because of the wider barrel at the top (root of hair), it did give my hair amazing volume compared to what I normally get (not big and poofy or anything, but a nice amount of volume over other irons).  I did really like that aspect of it.  It also does get very hot and the curls stay better than when I use other irons.I did notice that my ends looked frizzy.  I don't understand how it can look frizzy when it doesn't when I use the marcel iron and leave out the last inch or two.  I would think the ends would look the same.  I use Moroccanoil on my hair/ends after styling it every day.  Once I used the moroccanoil, the frizzies went away, so they were no longer an issue. I always just use my fingers to comb out the curls once I'm done, so I can't tell you how it looks if you would want to comb or brush it afterwards.All in all, I liked the iron.  I plan to use it on days when I have extra time (I am normally rushed in the mornings before work, so I probably won't use it a whole lot during the week) since I have to use smaller sections of hair with each curl.  I love the volume it gives me at the roots.  I don't curl the ends anyway, so the problem others were having with that issue did not affect me at all.  I did keep hitting the power button and turning it off.  I had to make myself get in the habit of checking for the on light after every curl. I would recommend this to somebody who doesn't want the ends curled", "categories": ["Beauty", "Hair Care", "Styling Tools"], "coreclasses": [["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Nutrition Bars"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Protein"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Post-Workout & Recovery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Amino Acids"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Stationery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Gift Wrapping Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Health Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Mirrors"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Hair Coloring Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Nail Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Makeup Brushes & Tools"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Nails"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Makeup Sets"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories"], ["Beauty", "Makeup"], ["Beauty", "Bath & Body"], ["Beauty"]]}

With this, I have purchased almost one of every other type of tangle, including the tangle jr., that I could find. One of each, for EACH child. I, my husband, and my children's Psychologist, all think they are very good for my children. My daughter's OCD disorder has become more controlled and she is less likely to submit to her compulsion than she would've been previously, due to having something to keep her hands busy, with her tangles. Her teacher has even allowed her to keep one on her desk at school for times like tests, or anything that causes her to be nervous where her compulsion surfaces. On the other hand, my Autistic son is subject to melt downs, and I find that handing him a tangle or two will help him simmer down more quickly while in the midst of a meltdown. Also, my husband even loves the tangle fidget toys while he is involved in watching a movie, or while working and reading over, or thinking of what to put into, a particular e-mail, or something that takes his undivided attention. Usually he would bite his nails when he would become engrossed and now he will reach for a tangle on occasion. When he does, he doesn't bite his nails. These devices are excellent for anyone with similar compulsion disorders that involve their hands, or if you just need to get someone's attention, like my son in the middle of a meltdown.

{"asin": "B004SKX8M0", "reviewText": "The interesting thing about this gun is that it runs off a flywheel system, with the \"automatic\" part being some sort of governor plunger that pushes discs into the flywheels at a set rate.  This gives the blaster a good reliable rate and range of fire, meaning that the learning curve is pretty simple.  The integrated handgaurd safety that powers up the flywheels was a clever design, I like it a lot more than the flywheel release on something like, say, the barricade.  That said, I would not recommend this gun to any hardcore nerfer.  The reason for this is that it doesn't really provide anything the Praxis or the Vigilon can't do for half the cost or less.  Basically the key killer for the Nitron is its rate of fire.  It fires about 1-1.5 discs per second.  This puts it in a weird position, since that's not fast enough to be something like a squad support blaster or a front man, but the weight of the 6 C-Batteries means that as a sniper it's too much excess weight.  The nature of the Nitron's automatic fire puts it in a position where it's not really better than any of the other guns in the series, despite being 20 bucks more AT MINIMUM.  That's really the only reason for the 3 star review:It's a fun gun, but it's really heavy and expensive for the things it can do.  If you wanna buy your child a blaster, go with the Vigilon or the Praxis, since both are good and reliable, and no matter what the blaster is the firing mechanism is the same for all of the non powered guns, so you're getting the same range.  Do NOT get the nitron, as it's sadly a waste of money for what you get.TO A MODDER HOWEVER, this blaster is amazing, because if you up the voltage with some good old fashioned Li-Ion 3.7V Batteries instead of the 6 1.5V C-Batteries, you can seriously up the speed of the flywheels, making them get up to speed faster, spin faster, and making the automated plunger fire faster as well.  Thus if you're confident in your abilities and are willing to spend the money, you can seriously improve this blaster, making it lighter, faster, and still having that crazy 55Ft range! But it really needs to be modded to shine, making it only practical for a hard core modder.", "categories": ["Toys & Games", "Dress Up & Pretend Play", "Pretend Play"], "coreclasses": [["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Nutrition Bars"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Protein"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Post-Workout & Recovery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Amino Acids"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Stationery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Gift Wrapping Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Health Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Mirrors"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Hair Coloring Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Nail Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Makeup Brushes & Tools"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Nails"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Makeup Sets"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories"], ["Beauty", "Makeup"], ["Beauty", "Bath & Body"], ["Beauty"]]}

{"asin": "B00A88DQWI", "reviewText": "My first LEGO- TMNT set!!! And I&#8217;m super-excited!!I&#8217;ve been a LEGO fan since one and a half year but I&#8217;ve been a Turtles fan ever since their first motion picture was released in 1990. So I was double-happy when I heard that LEGO was gonna come out with Turtle sets!! And now that I have finally procured one, I am one VERY glad person!This set contains three minifigs, one small boat and one small vehicle.Starting with the BEST part..the minifigs! The ones in this set are Raphael, Fishface and  a foot soldier. Raphael, a turtle, is arguably one of the BEST minifigs to come from LEGO!!! I have hundreds of minifigs&#8230;and believe me, hardly one of them make me as happy as THIS one!! The green color on the entire body is very nice. The printing on the torso is good; on the legs also it&#8217;s nice. The headpiece is the best part! One good thing that LEGO did was to use one complete headpiece and not make it (turtle&#8217;s head) like a mask on top of the actual headpiece (for example, the &#8220;Legends of Chima&#8221; minifigs). Even the shell on Raphael&#8217;s back is realistic and amazing. But one complaint I have about the shell is that you have to fit it separately on the minifig, by putting it around it&#8217;s neck. The problem with this is that when you look at the minifig from the front, it&#8217;s very visible that there&#8217;s something around his neck, which I found bit irritating. Anyway, just a minor complaint. Another minor complaint about the shell-piece is that when you fix the shell on the turtle, then his hands don&#8217;t move backwards beyond a certain point because the shell prevents it. Raphael comes with two Sai (three actually, as there&#8217;s one extra). One complaint here is that it&#8217;s the same sai that you would have seen in a lot other sets. My point here is that LEGO should make unique weapons for each theme. Weapons are small pieces so I&#8217;m sure it would not cost that much to create new weapons for each theme . And also it&#8217;s always good to see new cool weapons rather than the same old ones.Fishface is an amazing minifig! Very beautiful! It can even be a collector&#8217;s item one day! I wish that he had a mouth where the lower jaw would open and close!! It looked like that when I first saw this minifig on the box. Anyway, not a problem! Fishface doesn&#8217;t carry any weapon, sadly. Wish LEGO would have given him at least a sword or a gun, as he&#8217;s the main bad guy!The last minifig is the Foot soldier. He&#8217;s the least-good-looking of the three. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that he&#8217;s bad! He&#8217;s more-than-decent to look at. He&#8217;s got nice printing on his torso and back. His head looks cool, with circular (spaced-out-kind) white eyes with red headband. He carries two shurikens (three, since there&#8217;s an extra one in the set) but I wish LEGO would have given him a sword, as shurikens look like a secondary weapon.The boat in this set, that Fishface drives, is just about OK, nothing that great. One nice thing about this boat is that it contains two ooze canisters, which look pretty good. Another good thing is that this boat contains some round bricks fitted on the boat because of which it will move smoothly on any surface, when you push it. I guess all LEGO boats are built this way, but it&#8217;s nice.This boat contains a play-feature wherein if you push one leave, one ooze canister gets tossed. It&#8217;s an okay feature to have. Now, one problem is that when you fix Fishface on the boat, it&#8217;s impossible to make him hold the steering/controlling-levers of the boat.But, disappointingly, in the box-art it shows that Fishface is conveniently holding the steering of the boat! This is a misguiding from LEGO, something which I&#8217;m NOT happy about. This is the second time I&#8217;ve noticed that LEGO is doing such thing . First time I found such a thing was in the &#8220;Star Wars Sith Troopers Vs Republic Trooper&#8221; set. Anyway, I hope LEGO stops using FALSE images/pictures on their boxes.Now, coming to the Stealth Shell. It&#8217;s a pretty good-looking vehicle, with three wheels. Moves very smoothly. The tyres ,in olive green look very cool. The back two tyres are the same; the front one is built thicker. This vehicle contains lot of flick missiles (two in back, two in front), so good for those who just adore flick missiles (NOT me, though). This vehicle contains a big flap-kinda-thing in the middle, which you have to lift to put Raphael inside. One complaint here is that, you can&#8217;t make the turtle sit in the driver&#8217;s seat, you HAVE to make him lie down, in order for the flap to close. This is bad design. One reason is that then you make the turtle lie down, his hands are nowhere near the controls. And also, it always looks good when the driver is in sitting position, rather than lying down. Anyway, just a personal opinion. There are two flame pieces at the end, which really add to the beauty of the vehicle.One thing I hate about LEGO is..stickers. And the smaller they are, the bigger the problem. It&#8217;s difficult to get them pasted  at the right position in the first attempt. And if you remove them a few times, and try again and again to get them in the right position  , they get smudged at the ends. LEGO should permanently do away with stickers..and come with only printed bricks. And printed bricks look WAY better than stickered ones.In the end, I would say that I really love this set! Awesome minifigs (especially Raphael and Fishface). Very nice vehicle. In fact, I might buy three more of this sets, so that I&#8217;ll have a Stealth shell for each of the four turtles!!", "categories": ["Toys & Games", "Building Toys", "Building Sets"], "coreclasses": [["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Nutrition Bars"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Protein"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Post-Workout & Recovery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Amino Acids"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Stationery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Gift Wrapping Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Health Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Mirrors"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Hair Coloring Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Nail Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Makeup Brushes & Tools"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Nails"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Makeup Sets"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories"], ["Beauty", "Makeup"], ["Beauty", "Bath & Body"], ["Beauty"]]}

{"asin": "B002Q6VU5A", "reviewText": "People seem to either love this or hate it.  I am definitely a lover of the Miele STB101 Mini Turbo Brush.Here's 4 reasons why: four cats.  The lazy indoor-only kind that sleep all day on soft things.  I can tell my black cat's favorite soft surface du jour by the breadth and depth of the black fur he leaves behind.This mini turbo brush removes EVERY cat hair in just a few swipes in both directions.  I have several cream-colored blankets he has adopted and I thought they could never be cleaned.  Machine washing and drying never extracts the fur enough, and I can use an entire lint brush (the kind with sticky paper) before and after washing and still see fur.  With the turbo brush, I can remove all visible hair easily, then can wash the blanket.Some people don't like the brush because it is air-generated and can seize up at times without its own machine drive mechanism.  I do encounter this, but after many uses, I find this happens on some surfaces more than others.  If I just use a light touch, adjust the suction, and/or move the brush in the opposite direction, no problems at all.  The Turbobrush work best when there is air behind the item being vacuumed.  For instance, if I lift up a bedspread to vacuum it - as opposed to keeping it flat on the bed - I never have problems with the mechanism seizing up.Just be very careful handling this attachment while in use.  Don't get your hands, clothing, or hair too close to the brush.  I thought this warning was pretty silly when I saw it in the instructions, but as I use the brush more and more, I can see that I do often bring the attachment close to my body as I navigate about with it.  Definitely, make sure you engage or disengage it with the machine OFF.This brush picks cat hair (even embedded ones) off soft blankets and upholstery like no other vacuum attachment I have ever used.

It heats up quickly to 300+ and does the job, straightening about an inch-wide swath at a time.It's really lightweight, and because it comes with its own little roll-up, magnetized-closure travel case, complete with elastic bands to keep the iron and cord in place, it's super easy to throw into your purse or carry-on.Things to consider:I'm not sure what the seller means by dual voltage. It has a regular American plug, so if you want to use it overseas, you'll need to bring along an adapter. There's no switch on it that regulates its power output.Since it has just 2 settings, on & off, if you are obsessed with dialing around for some kind of optimum temperature, that's not going to happen.My hair is naturally wavy, but not curly, and it is not thick.

{"asin": "B001FM6ZLU", "reviewText": "Bought 11 of these 2-lb jars since April of 2012. They tasted great (if you're used to how rice powders taste--sort of a semi-sweet grainy taste with a gritty texture).But, the last 4 jars smelled terrible. When I open the first of the last 4, I could smell a sharp rancid odor, the same kind of smell you get when you have cooking oil or corn tortilla chips that sat around for 2 years past their expiration date.I opened the other 3 jars, and they had the same rancid odor. I tried letting the jar breathe, but the smell didn't go away. I tried mixing them in water and drinking them, but the smell didn't go away.My hypothesis is that these products were shipped to me during the peak of Summer, and the high temperatures inside the trucks for several days affected the product:(1) the heat caused the rice powder to go rancidOR(2) the heat caused the HDPE container to leach out a plastic odor that resembled the odor of rancid oils (sort of like having water that's been sitting around in a hot container in the sun for a while, and when you drink it, it tastes like plastic).Now that the hot season is over, I'll order more and try again. I'll update on the next batch.--------------------UPDATE 1:Need to add that I stored the 4 jars in a dark & cool room of about 60-degrees Fahrenheit.Also, need to add that if my Hypothesis #2 is correct, it's still not acceptable to me. Though a plastic smell in food or water is not going to kill you, according to David Suzuki, we carry \"several pounds of plastic and dozens of toxic molecules dissolved in our bodies...\" (search David Suzuki)And, according to other scientists, we have kitchen plastics in our bodies (search How Plastic We've Become: Our Bodies Carry Residues of Kitchen Plastics)When I get a new batch, I'll test the 2nd hypothesis by placing the normal, non-rancid product in a box in the trunk of my car for 3 days:(A) 1 scoop powder in a glass jar (baby food jar)(B) 1 scoop powder in the original HDPE jarAfter 3 days in the sun, I'll report any changes to its odor compared to the controls. The controls will be 1 scoops in the same containers, but placed in a dark & cool room for the same duration as the test scoops.-----------------UPDATE 2:This product is NOT supposed to be sold in California, because it lacks the Prop 65 warning mandated by the State of California. Even though I live in California, Amazon has been selling this product to me.-----------------UPDATE 3 (2013 October 8):I haven't been able to conduct any tests because Amazon didn't ship any products to me for a long time. But, this past month, Amazon finally shipped it to me (I had it on Subscribe).Here's what I've noticed.  The product content has changed, though the packaging and label are identical to before. It's different now in that the powder is now EXTREMELY fine, as opposed to coarse, and now I get a dust cloud every time I take a scoop.  It sometimes makes me sneeze.  Mixing it into the water is a lot easier now, but stirring the spoon releases another dust cloud.The product is now a bit bitter, and it tastes awful like metal or soap or something.  It also foams up a lot, and I don't drink the foam.Given the huge changes, I wonder if the nutritional facts should be updated, because such a differently processed product along with the different flavor might be different nutritionally, especially in the amount of calcium, iron and other minerals and metals.", "categories": ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Protein"], "coreclasses": [["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Nutrition Bars"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Protein"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Post-Workout & Recovery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Amino Acids"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Stationery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Gift Wrapping Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Health Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Mirrors"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Hair Coloring Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Nail Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Makeup Brushes & Tools"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Nails"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Makeup Sets"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories"], ["Beauty", "Makeup"], ["Beauty", "Bath & Body"], ["Beauty"]]}

He was absolutely ravenous for one after having seen a commercial on TV.We had one blissful day around here with him occupied with it pretty much constantly. Dinosaur, car, dinosaur, car, dinosaur, car. The sound effects are fine, not too annoying, not too loud.  My son actually chooses to have the sounds turned off entirely.After that one blissful day, my son has barely given this toy a second glance. There've been one or two little spurts of interest, and actually last night he concocted a Godzilla-like scenario using this toy that was pretty fun to watch. But by and large, this is not a toy for your child UNLESS your child is very into imaginative scenarios. My son is very interested in the mechanics of this toy, but he is generally not into imaginative play (last night notwithstanding), so for him it's not a toy with any legs to speak of.He has also reported to me that he no longer enjoys the transforming of the toy, because when it's in car mode and you're trying to switch it to dino mode, the snapping upward of the car's hood to transform it to the dino head is very hard to do. I tried it, and he's right. Also, when the toy is in dino mode, it doesn't take much for the head/neck to disengage and retreat halfway back into vehicle mode. This is a design issue, or it's a durability issue, not sure which, but it has caused headaches around here and more headaches, I do not need.Having said all that, for the price amazon's getting for this thing, it's not a horrible buy.

Vitamix has long been an industry leader in the realm of high quality blenders. This blender has a large capacity, a multispeed knob, a powerful motor, and comes with a book and DVD to get you familiar with what it can do and many recipes you can use it with. This blender is not hard to use, it can be cleaned without too much difficulty (not as easily as a &#34;bullet&#34; type blender) and it can handle pretty much anything you put in it. This blender is great if you are making things for multiple people (unlike the personal size blenders like Nutribullet, where the container doesn't hold that much). There is a 5 year warranty in case anything goes wrong with it. The 2 peak output horsepower motors spins the stainless steel blade superfast on the higher speeds, and the BPA free container comes with a special covered handle for a comfortable grip.If you are looking for a high quality, pro-style blender for home use, the Vitamix is the best choice if you can afford it. I've used standard inexpensive blenders before and those are OK for many uses but not as powerful and versatile as this. The Magic Bullet/Nutribullet blenders don't allow for multiple speeds or large loads, and they have weaker motors and are not really as durable as this. I like my Nutribullet for making a quick smoothie, but if I were making it for multiple people it would be a task for the Vitamix. Other popular blenders like Nutribullet are good for what they offer but are not in the same class as a Vitamix. For heavy duty blending blenders like Ninja and Blendtec offer some pretty good options, and they are OK for those who aren't ready for the expense of Vitamix, although this reconditioned Vitamix helps bridge the price gap.

But if you do it right, the pain is basically like rubbing bare feet really hard on a carpeted floor; no biggie.Some tips for making it easier and more convenient:- I do not use a double-boiler. I use a thick glass candle holder. Break off a hunk from the bar and throw it on in.- I do not use the stove or microwave. I have a regular candle warmer that does the job perfectly. It takes a while, sometimes as much as 2 hours depending on how much wax is in there. But it's the type of thing where I can turn it on in the late afternoon and it's ready when it's time for my shower, etc. The reason I prefer this method is because you just turn the warmer on and forget about it. You don't have to watch over it, and there's little mess.- If you don't mind having little pieces of hair in your wax, REUSE it. I bought this 7oz bar back in June and have only used 1/4 of it. The more hair there is, the thicker you have to put it on, but it doesn't inhibit the wax's job. When it starts to do so, stop reusing it.

{"asin": "B00061URFG", "reviewText": "I received this today and after spending time hooking it up, reading the directions, all psyched up to use this thing, the serial port connector won't fit. I read the book again and find out a mention that it requires a serial port adapter, that is not included. Nowhere was this mentioned in the ordering process that you don't have all you need to get it going.So I went to two electronic stores in the area and was told the same thing in both places when I showed the clerks this Proteus equipment and the adapter they sent me. They took one look at the 9 pins and informed me this was an OBSOLETE item! Unusable on any modern computer (it works only on 10 year old computers), and the adapter needed to make it work isn't even available on the market! I was told even if I found an adapter I would likely have trouble with it using a later model PC.I am just disgusted and have never been so unhappy with an Amazon purchase. I cannot comment on the quality of the system itself, the sound/light function, but the 'hardware' itself is extremely flimsy and cheap. The Proteus device is like a cheap cassette player from the 80s, the headphones equally bottom of the barrel quality.Also the instructions and advice is extremely complicated and confusing. It seems geared to people who are programmers, not the layman.I was thinking of getting a Laxman (the much upgraded version that is much more expensive, from the same manufacturer), but after my experience with this company I just can't trust them. Nowhere in the order process was I warned about the need for another device, and that that device might be very hard to find -- (why the heck wouldn't they include a usable adapter?).Obviously it is going back tomorrow, but I am sure disappointed, I was looking forward to trying this.", "categories": ["Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Stress Reduction"], "coreclasses": [["Toys & Games", "Electronics for Kids", "Systems & Accessories"], ["Toys & Games", "Electronics for Kids", "Personal Video Players & Accessories"], ["Toys & Games", "Electronics for Kids", "Plug & Play Video Games"], ["Toys & Games", "Electronics for Kids"], ["Toys & Games", "Games", "Battling Tops"], ["Toys & Games", "Games", "Game Accessories"], ["Toys & Games", "Games", "Game Collections"], ["Toys & Games", "Games", "Board Games"], ["Toys & Games"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Bath", "Bathroom Accessories"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Bath", "Towels"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Bath", "Bath Rugs"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Bath"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Furniture", "Home Entertainment Furniture"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Furniture", "Home Office Furniture"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Furniture", "Living Room Furniture"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Furniture"], ["Home & Kitchen", "Bedding"], ["Home & Kitchen"]]}

I'll try to address a few here.Cartridge Shaver:If you use a regular cartridge like a Schick Quattro, Gillette Fusion/Mach 3 or even Remington's own (which I don't recommend) then this is a very good gel.  It's super slick so you get great glide with little to no pull.  It's also cleans up easily so you aren't stuck with a goopy mess on your face that you have to try and scrape off after the shave.  All in all, it's one of the better inexpensive off the shelf shaving gels I've used. - 4 1/2 starsTraditional \"Wet Shaver\":I've you're a wet shaver using either straight razors or double edged safety razors I can't really recommend this product.  It is very slick as previously mentioned but it was designed for cartridge use.  It doesn't really lather and give almost no cushion for more exposed blades.  Even the most experience wet shaver is likely to nick themselves. - 2 starsMenthol Addict Shaver:Are you a menthol-head?  Is Osage Rub your go-to aftershave?  Do you expect face freezing blasts of menthol from your shaving creams/gels/soaps?  This is not for you.  This particular gel only offers the mildest of cooling effects.

There are lots of extras included, such as an exfoliation glove for in the shower, a Precision comb attachment if you just want to trim down, but not remove all the hair, a travel bag, which I use as a storage case, and a pen trimmer, which can be used to touch up the bikini line or even for small areas like the face. The Bikini perfect can stay charged for up to 60 minutes and does not need to be oiled, so there is no maintenance involved. I myself have had laser hair removal, but being a redhead, cannot get rid of any blonde hair on my body, so this is perfect for my little touch-ups once in a while. What a great product!

{"asin": "B000053L6Y", "reviewText": "This is a nice, classically manly-smelling aftershave.  It smells very similar to, and nicely complements, the Clubman Pinaud talc.  I would say it's a pretty good value at this price point.  It is one of several scents that remind me of barbershops (another isClubman Jeris Osage Rub, 14 Fluid Ounce, which probably produces the most intense cooling sensation you can get without placing your face into ice water).However, here is a word of advice to anyone who is new to old-school wetshaving: if you really want to reduce skin irritation after shaving with a blade, don't use this, or any other alcohol-based aftershave.  You want a glycerin-based product.  My favorite is George F. Trumper brand \"skin food\" (especially this one:Geo F. Trumper Limes Skin Food, 100ml).  These products cost a bit more, but are dramatically better at soothing your skin after shaving.  Any alcohol-based \"lotion\" will sting, and something like the Trumper skin food does not (it's actually so soothing I occasionally use it on the patches of eczema I develop on my arms in the driest part of winter).  If you shave with a brush, good shaving cream or soap (NOT FOAM OR GEL FROM A CAN, but something from a tube or tub, of which there are numerous options), and a good blade (honestly, old-school double-edged safety razors are far superior to so-called \"modern\" cartridge razors), and if you use skin food afterward, you'll get the best shave possible.  With that strategy, and by shaving in the shower with lots of hot water, I can get a shave that is even better than a barbershop straight-razor shave.Back to the actual product being reviewed, though--if your skin isn't significantly irritated, or if you're really going to use aftershave as a cologne, not applying it right after shaving, this is a nice option.  It's pleasant, but not overly strong, and in the proper context I do recommend it.", "categories": ["Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Shaving & Hair Removal"], "coreclasses": [["Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Shaving & Hair Removal"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Foot Care"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Body Art"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Ear Care"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Therapeutic Skin Care"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Stress Reduction"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Stimulants"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Health Care"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Medical Supplies & Equipment", "Daily Living Aids"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Medical Supplies & Equipment"], ["Health & Personal Care"], ["Beauty", "Skin Care", "Sets & Kits"], ["Beauty", "Skin Care", "Face"], ["Beauty", "Skin Care", "Sun"], ["Beauty", "Skin Care"], ["Beauty", "Hair Care", "Styling Products"], ["Beauty", "Hair Care", "Hair & Scalp Treatments"], ["Beauty", "Hair Care", "Hair Loss Products"], ["Beauty", "Bath & Body"]]}

{"asin": "B0037KMI0U", "reviewText": "This product does what it sets out to do, clean clothes.  I must be honest; I usually buy whatever is on sale when it comes to laundry detergent.  Why, one might ask?  Well because laundry detergent is one of those items that are always expensive in store.  I am not sure why but breakfast cereal usually suffers the same fate.  Tide is one of the brands that are usually more \"costly\" than other brands.  However, I decided to take a chance on this product.The first thing I would like to state is that the detergent smells very, very clean.  In addition, to this product smelling clean, it does a great job getting clothing clean.  There are two fifty ounce bottles in this package.  They each clean about 32 loads of laundry.  Now I am not a really messing person, so I am not sure if this detergent would clean King Kong's clothes, but it did a wonderful job for my loads of laundry.  The bottles are also smaller, so you are saving some space.  That is always a good thing.As for Amazon's \"Frustration-Free Packaging\", I think it really works.  Both bottles of Tide are sealed in a box and this box is taped very securely.  Then this box (with the Tide in it) is sealed in another box and shipped to the customer.  This reduces the likelihood that the detergent explodes or is punctured during shipping. My product was in perfect condition when it arrived.  As for my prior statement about Tide being one of the more costly detergents.  This statement is less true when ordering it from Amazon, the price is a bit less on Amazon then it would be in the grocery store, nevertheless laundry detergent is expensive in general.

Now 20 years later, and Simon has had a technology upgrade and pretty new packaging, but still retains the same classic fun of the original game.  In this new version, the colors are separated into 4 distinct cubes. The cubes interact with each other and work together to make up four different games. No reading required, which opens this up to kids of different age ranges.To start a game, touch the cube with the corresponding color:> Green = this is the classic Simon that I remember. Follow and match the color sequence that keeps getting longer and longer.> Yellow = lights off. Goal is to find the secret cube order. You need to try and line up the cubes into the order the game is looking for.  As you lock a cube into the right sequence, it's light will turn off. You've won when all the cube lights shut off.> Blue = Secret Color. Similar to \"Lights Off\".  The goal here is to find the secret cube order that will turn all the cubes the same color. This time though, each time you lock a cube into place, the colors change.  You've won when all the cubes show same color.> Red = shuffle. The game flashes a sequence of colors and you have to match it.This game comes with 4 electronic cubes and a game case that is not only great for storage, but required for playing some of the games.  Also comes with the 2 AAA batteries that each cube requires.  I also like that the cubes automatically turn off when not in use to conserve battery life.Overall, I think the new technology offers a nice face lift to a classic game. Now here is where I have to take off some points. We played this game with 6 year old, 7 year old, and 10 year old boys.  They immediately grabbed this game and started playing.  The first thing we found was that the instructions were not fantastic. These kids were readers, but still needed adult intervention to explain the rules. This wasn't a huge deal, but in a world where my son can pick up any DS game and learn on the fly, I feel like this game could be better marketed if instructions were clearer.  Once they got the rules down, they played each game one time. Then they were done. That's it. The game was relegated to our toy box graveyard, never to be played with again. So this is why I give the toy 3 stars. From a parent perspective, I find the toy educational, durable, and entertaining.  5 stars.  But if my kid won't play with it, and none of his friends will play with it, then I just wasted money.  So I just can't recommend this one. Sorry Simon.

{"asin": "B008D5DWOU", "reviewText": "The Vornado Tower Heater is designed to heat an entire room rather than a localized area. It has a thermostat dial, a fan that you can set to either cycle on or off or run continually, and three heat settings (low &#8211; maximum of 750 watts; medium &#8211; maximum of 1125 watts; and high &#8211; maximum of 1500 watts). As a safety feature, if the heater overheats it will automatically shut off. It has tight grill spacing so curious children can&#8217;t stick their fingers in the heater; a cool touch case; and will automatically shut off if tipped over.Earlier this winter I cam home from work to discover my furnace had stopped working. The plumber got it back working within two hours but in that short period of time the house got very cold and I realized how handy a space heater could be so I was happy to be able to get the Vornado Tower Heater. I&#8217;ve been quite pleased with it &#8211; it does an excellent job. Even on low it heats up an entire room.

The light performs like a champ in that regard. I feel a little lift after it has been on for a little while. Also, the light truly fills the room with what seems to be actual sunlight (perception being what it is). Super bright in other words. I like that it has a few different time settings on it as well.So, I liked it so much I bought a second one for our bedroom. On days where I wake up but am really dragging, I crank this on and chill for a few minutes. Wakes me up all the way.Now, my girlfriend on the other hand does use this for its intended purpose, and she loves it as well.

I used my Dremmel to cut through the one end of the lid of each compartment, so that I could remove the lid from the pop after it was frozen, and then we would just have the frozen pop and the stick.  So, yes, it worked, and we can use the pop as a kind of stirrer in a drink, without the lid.  I don't think the lid will last long with the cut in it, but it was an interesting experiment....

Short grain Japanese rice comes out, oh, so, beautifully! Even my mother, a hard-core Japanese woman, thinks it's awesome. I also cooked Indian basmati rice, Spanish long grain rice, wild rice, brown rice...you name it, any type of rice I tried came out absolutely perfectly.I'm not trying to sound nationalistic, but I'd recommend anyone who plans to buy a new rice cooker to make sure that your new purchase is MADE IN JAPAN. The entire nation of Japan has been obsessed with cooking perfect rice. This product is one of the results of the national obsession. It's a bit more pricey, but it's worth it. Zojirushi has been long known in Japan for superior quality.This rice cooker sings. When you press the start button, you'd hear a cute melody that lets you know the cooking is started. 40 minutes later, you'd hear another cute melody that lets you know the rice is done! Believe it or not, those melodies are by Mozart and by French King Louis XIII. Who would expect digital Mozart in the kitchen while preparing 3 cups of rice?

This toy doesn't offer anything that sitting down a reading a book to your child doesn't. When just reading a story, the voice is flat and emotionless. Not very exciting. My three-year-old can't seem to follow the directions (point to the green circle) and I don't know if she doesn't want to (she's independent) or doesn't quite understand. Whith practice, hopefully she'll get better. Some of the games are a little advanced, but might be better for a five-year-old, especially the rhyming games in \"Wocket.\"The biggest problem, though, is the design. The on/off button is located in the lower right corner. If you're right handed, your wrist lays across the on/off button. It take barely any pressure to turn it on or off. The default on the volume is set to very, very low, so often she'll turn it on, not realize it's on, then turn it off trying to make it work.The other mechanical problem is with the cartridges. If you have the wrong cartridge (or no cartridge) in, it sings songs, tells rymes, washes dishes -- everything except say, \"Please insert the correct cartridge.\"I think she'll enjoy it, but I wouldn't call it a \"must have\" toy.

And even without the book on hand it will read the whole book to you, like an audiobook.  I agree the system would benefit from more memory, but it forces my son to plan ahead when we go on trips.  Again though, no cartridges!

I HAVE to do housework and all the things that come with being a mom. It's wonderful when I find products, like this one, that not only keeps him occupied and having fun, but is also teaching him valuable information.We're working on teaching my 3 year old the alphabet right now, so this is perfect for him. I think the \"touch\" feature makes him feel grown up. ;) The \"voice\" of the toy is never hard to understand. She pronounces the words, letters, and sounds very well, in my opinion.The only somewhat complaint I have about this toy is how easily the surface scratches. With this type of toy, that's to be expected, though. I didn't think about it until I saw the scratches, though. Our flooring downstairs is wood, so we moved this particular toy upstairs to our carpeted floor, so scratches won't be such an issue.Overall, we love this toy!

{"asin": "B009HEZ03W", "reviewText": "According to the box, these EKLUND ESSENTIAL OMEGA softgels consist of purified Norwegian fish oil in pharmaceutical grade, superior triglyceride form.  The softgels are quite large--about one inch long--but they're easy to swallow.  To me, they are completely tasteless; certainly they have no fishy taste, either before or after swallowing.  The box further states that in clinical studies Omega 3 supplementation has been shown \"to reduce inflammation, improve brain, eye, skin, and joint health, improve mood, and contribute to healthy weight loss\", although \"these statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration\".My own online research revealed that fish (or fish oil) naturally contains Omega-3 fatty acids, which are thought to be beneficial in preventing heart attack, stroke, and some cancers; in treating symptoms of inflammatory diseases such as arthritis or ulcerative colitis; in reducing depression and anxiety; and in quite a few other ways.  However, taking fish oil supplements may not confer the same benefits as eating fish (or fish oil), particularly with respect to preventing heart attacks, strokes, or cancers.Before I try any new supplement, I always check with the Consumer Labs site to see whether the product has been \"approved\". (CL reports on whether products contain supplements in the amounts claimed on labels, and whether they contain anything harmful).  As of July 2013, CL had not tested any Eklund product, so CL had no information about the manufacturer and no opinion about this particular product.The recommended dosage for EKLUND ESSENTIAL OMEGA is three softgels per day, so one bottle constitutes a 30-day supply.  At Amazon's current price (about $28), the supplementation regimen costs about 93 cents a day.  Because there are cheaper fish oil supplements available, you should be sure to check the label to make sure that this product is the right one for you.Each softgel has 15 calories; and each softgel contains 1370 mg of fish oil concentrate, 800 mg of Omega-3 fatty acids, 430 mg of EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid), 290 mg of DHA (docosahexanenoic acid), and 80 mg of additional Omega-3 fatty acids.  The general product ingredients are: highly refined and concentrated Omega-3 fish oil (anchovy, sardine, mackerel), capsule shell (gelatin, glycerin, purified water), natural lemon/lime flavor, proprietary antioxidant blend (consisting of natural tocopherois (soy), rosemary extract, and ascorbyl palmitate).Because I've only used this product for a short time, I can't express any opinion on how effective it is as a supplement (even for me personally).  However, it seems to be a good product, it's easy to swallow, and I haven't experienced any bad reactions.Disclaimer note:  This review is based on a product supplied to me free of charge for review purposes.

The product got all the hair off, but some hairs are still about 1/16\" long. I think I may have left it on too long because one spot became red and raw. If you have sensitive skin I would definitely test a small area (which it tells you do anyway) before using it. I will probably reapply to the same area in several days to see if it will get rid of the short hairs that it left behind. The product is thick, easy to spread, and stays on well. Just spread it on with the provided wooden stick, wait several minutes, jump in the shower (do not use soap on the area), and wipe it off! Afterwards, you can apply the Calm Balm which really helps soothes the area. It would be nice if the bottles came in a larger size.UPDATE: 2012-03-22 After using this product again \"down there\" I have realized my skin does not agree with this product (I have always had somewhat sensitive skin). Left the product on for about seven minutes and an area about 1\" x 1/2\" became red, raw, and bled slightly (obviously dissolving more than just the hair). Unfortunately I will not continue using it \"down there.\" I might use it again on a less sensitive area of my body. I am keeping my four star review on it.

{"asin": "B003Z34OME", "reviewText": "The oven arrived in 2 days with Prime so I had to use it :) My oven thermometer confirmed temp accuracy at 425 degrees while cooking fish sticks. It is easy to program and the light with glass door makes it easy to view food.I did try a 13 x 9 cake pan which has no lip and it fits with zero wiggle room. I doubt I would use it with convection as it covers almost all the fan vents, but it would be fine for standard baking. I will probably use smaller pans for most cooking. The included enamel coated broiler pan and rack seem durable for the,purpose. The glass front, top areas get the hottest. There is some radiant heat coming into the room but minimal compared to my standard oven. Best part is there is barely any preheat required. My standard oven required almost 25 minutes so that alone should help the electric bill. In Florida I like anything that reduces that bill ! My fish sticks were cooked 5 minutes earlier than expected. I used parchment in a metal pie pan but had to remove the parchment in the first 10 minutes as it was getting quite brown ( it was trimmed to fit the pan)so don't plan to use it anymore in this type of confined area. After reading about problems using Pyrex glassware, I ordered a Emile Henry clay based gratinee dish so I can brown cheese topped foods near the broiler occasionally. I haven't had time to, try all the features, but will update my review in a few weeks.First look says this is a nice toaster oven for the price with all the features I wanted. It takes up less space than my 1200 watt microwave. The cord is only about 20 inches long, good for me, but may require some people to need an extension. It has a two prong grounded outlet plug. I did not have any issues with the cord getting to warm. At 1300 watts, it should more than meet my needs cooking small meals or casseroles, bagels, etc.EDIT: I just received the Chicago Metallic 4 pc set with muffin .pan and they are. perfect size for small quantities to bake or broil.The pans are shallow so would not expect to make a cake, but it would serve to roast veggies or small portions of a casserole dish or fish sticks. For cakes I would use my standard size 8x8 or 9x9 deeper pans. I hear the 6 muffin pan fits a Jiffy recipe so that is nice.As for the toaster oven, clock is keeping accurate time after 24 hours. I used a light spray of windex on paper towel to clean the grease splatters from my batter fried fish yesterday, looks fine.UPDATE 12-19-13 clock continues at correct time, settings are easy to use, preheat takes 7 minutes approx so I set my time in advance per the recipe to include 7 minutes, monitor with another timer to put in the food and still expect my food to be done 3-4 minutes earlier than recipe requires. I am having to rethink some of my cooking as I usually have avoided small items that would require my full size oven BUT now I can cook those things economically in this smaller oven. It will not fit a full size roasting chicken as it would be too close to the top oven burners but I am planning to try a small meat loaf this week and a cherry crisp later today...no regrets here.UPDATE 12/30/13 clock still keeping correct time. I am cooking at 25 degrees lower than recipes call for and also a few minutes lesswith great results, quick heat up  5 minutes and cool down compared to standard oven, important in Florida heat.", "categories": ["Home & Kitchen", "Kitchen & Dining", "Small Appliances"], "coreclasses": [["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Nutrition Bars"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Protein"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Post-Workout & Recovery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Amino Acids"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Stationery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Gift Wrapping Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Health Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Mirrors"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Hair Coloring Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Nail Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Makeup Brushes & Tools"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Nails"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Makeup Sets"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories"], ["Beauty", "Makeup"], ["Beauty", "Bath & Body"], ["Beauty"]]}

{"asin": "B003TLO0O4", "reviewText": "I ordered this flatware set to get rid of my older, cheap flatware that I had been using.  I was a bit hesitant due to some reviewers claiming that the pieces were very lightweight, flimsy, had sharp edges, etc.  I must say, I am VERY pleased with my purchase!Obviously, the quantity of flatware you get in this set just can not be beaten.  You get more silverware than most families will ever need to use for a single meal, which is certainly a welcome change to paying $100 for 5 place settings.  The hostess set is also a great addition, and included at no additional charge.  It'll certainly come in handy!While the smaller spoons included in the set are fairly large compared to what I'm accustomed to, they're certainly not unusable or unmanageable at all.  Perhaps they'd be a bit difficult for small children to manage, but that's not a concern in my household.  If you have small children in your household, or who visit regularly, you may want to seek out a set of smaller spoons in a matching, or complimenting, pattern for their smaller hands and mouths.Addressing the weight/strength issue brought up by many other reviewers:  I find these to be fairly heavy.  For each of the pieces included for place setting, I'm going to list their weights.  (I've weighed them using a postage scale that is accurate to within 0.1 gram, for reference.)  Salad fork: 0.97oz/27.5g; Dinner Fork: 1.22oz/34.6g; Teaspoon: 1.07oz/30.3g;  Tablespoon: 1.515oz/42.9g; Butter knife: 2.795oz/79.3g.  To me, those weights feel quite hefty in hand (though, certainly not *heavy*), and I have yet to have a single piece show a scratch, bend, or any other form of damage in the 30+ days of use (and dishwasher cleaning) since receiving them.Upon opening the package, I inspected every piece, checking for rough or sharp edges on forks and spoons.  None of my pieces felt rough or sharp to my fingers or the skin on the underside of my forearm.  In daily use, neither I nor my spouse has had any discomfort from eating with any of the utensils.  Every piece still looks brand new, with no need to polish after washing them in the dishwasher.The simple, clean pattern on each piece is elegant enough for fancier occasions, and perfect for everyday use as well.  Each piece is a single, continuous piece of stainless steel, so there's no need to worry about attachment points or rivets where food or other debris may gather and be difficult to clean fully.  All in all, I'd call this the perfect flatware set for almost everyone.  I'm beyond satisfied with my purchase!", "categories": ["Home & Kitchen", "Kitchen & Dining", "Dining & Entertaining"], "coreclasses": [["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Nutrition Bars"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Protein"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Post-Workout & Recovery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Amino Acids"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Stationery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Gift Wrapping Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Health Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Mirrors"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Hair Coloring Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Nail Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Makeup Brushes & Tools"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Nails"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Makeup Sets"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories"], ["Beauty", "Makeup"], ["Beauty", "Bath & Body"], ["Beauty"]]}

{"asin": "B007JN6MQC", "reviewText": "This item is plowed with undeserved high ratings.Shame shame shame on Eureka's well meaning department of 'theoretical engineering' for making the world's chic-most  heating unit / weight lifting equipment and otherwise born-wrong and set to break waste of money. Save yours and get an even lower cost and slightly less attractive one.Ditch this, and get the Mighty Mite BAGGED vacuum, or the Pet one, or if you're noise-tolerant, a bagged Dirt Devil.Pro's - Under $100 dollars, Bagless, Less noise, hepa, large wheels, easy open canister, small light easy manoevering, genuine quality metal wand, ergonomic curved handle set of attachments and crevice tool, no loss of suction, retractable cord, compact, emits nice 'new car' smell.Cons- All of the pro's are deficits PLUS there are cons - like, this product line overheats and breaks readily (and that's a pretty serious design flaw.)  There IS a lemon in every lot, so any high volume item will have a number of one stars, but BAD DESIGNG affects all the units the same.Under $100- get a bag vacuum for that price, and lower.2 Less noise- you can't TELL if it's cleaning, so the trade off is you THINK you've cleaned when you haven't. The familiar rattle of something hitting (even losing suction IN) a bag is a GREAT thing- trust me, you'll see.3- Bagless: I cannot THINK of a worse design for 'easy clean' than this particular bagless design. A) you take it off the  insertion/removal site has NO lip, so as you remove it, you dump dirt on your floor. b) it gets static and so the dirt sticks ALL over the inside.  You don't flip the lid open and empty it. You actually have to take the whole thing apart and rinse it, or there's just dirt all over, and by the way, emptying it even without that throws dirt all over (negating the hepa filter. And negating having vacuumed in the first place. Re-using a bag, those even EMPTY far more neatly.)It's really convenient BUT- only if you really enjoy the convenience of cleaning up a huge mess of dirt on the floor AFTER vacuuming and then having  doing the equivalent of a small sinkful of awkward sticky dishes.Hepa- again idiotically bad design. Hepa filter is in the wheel, so it happens to pop out if you bump into anything. and blows dirt all over. B- it has a side vent, not a rear-vent so you're happily blowing the dust around that you want to vacuum up- Chase away, my friends, it's a new form of excercize.Small light manoevering- LOOKS ARE DECEIVING- it only rolls forward and back. Enjoy carrying your heavy new vacuum around your place. And, enjoy the convenience of not being able to easily store this massive klunky design. Maybe you can throw out six pairs of shoes or rent storage from the guy in the next apartment. But those are your 'small convenient' storage options if you don't live in Suburbia (and if you do, why did you get an apartment vacuum?)Happily it won't damage the furniture too much as you snag it on everything you own. Because, again, it only rolls forward and back- and not particularly well. But at least when you carry it, it also weighs a ton.Quality Metal Wand- nice work, you seldom see these on anything under a hundred dollars. But what the heck were the engineers thinking? \"America's small home dwellers simply don't get enough of a workout doing housework. Let us add a few unnecessary awkward pounds to that equation\"  This is great for people who like to wear ankle and wrist weights and look forward retro clunky storage and that 50's housewife feel. Save the chrome for the NON-portable appliances. Like, refrigerators, stoves and wine coolers.Comes with attachments- the awkwardly ergopsychotic handle is great for catching and clogging with things that cannot be removed by even the most dedicated plumber. Which is really only a problem for that percentage of American households that has a fur bearing pet, a child, or anyone who drops anything. That's almost nobody- no worries there- great OVER-thinking! The geometry is also fabulous for those of us who vacuum in a ballet first position- this will ONLY ever pose a problem for the handful of folks who like to clean UNDER their furniture.Comes with cleaning Attachments- how swell of them to include a high quality suction brush. Which only cleans backward, only when held at a certain angle, and which has front brushie- things- all of which a pretty hefty and complex design youd' think would be good for you, except it's not. It prevents the vaccum from being able to pick up- dust, hair, dirt and almost anything you'd want off your floors. BUT- at least the crevice tool is 4\" long- shortest one I've ever seen. Which is great for cleaning all those crevices you can clean WITHOUT a crevice tool. (Really what was the point of that??)  And there is some other wierd thingie that also takes up space and does nothing.What it lacks is any sort of small tool that fits under furniture (even with the yoga-enhancing freakshow of an 'ergonomic' handle and heavy long metal wand...) or a small ordinary funnel cleaner that allows you to vacuum up things that are in the proximity of the business-end of the sucker-device, without also being directly underneath the hyper-articulated tools it comes with.  So, you clean 1/4 of the area in twice the time. (Look out ZUMBA!)Retractable cord- what better thing to do with a retractable cord than to allow it to roll up and cause all kinds of heat and also absorb heat, directly from the motor WHILE you vacuum!Doubles as a space heater with fan, and so much the better because if there's one thing you LIKE in a vacuum you DON'T like- it's the vacuum's own engineering-built-in predisposition to commit suicide.Here's it's lifecyle. It's pretty! It's quite! It weighs a ton, it has more suction that you EVER want this side of a sawdust factory! And it's all designed to defeat itself! it sucks up EVERYTHING. Then you add an attachment and it sucks up NOT MUCh, unless you are getting drunk and playing twister with it! Then it just SITS there making you drag it's hulking mass around and moving furniture on it's behalf! Then you try the small attachment and end up crawling on the floor the long heavy wand was supposed to make EASY. Then you empty it and dirties the Room! Then you clumsily dismantle the Easy Clean Dust Compartment. Then you Wash it. Then you dry it! Then you go for the NEXT area while half the cable cooks the motor and the motor cooks the cable. Then it sucks up something TERRIBLE when you toss and just use the want without the goose or donkey attachment that fits nowhere and picks up nothing! Then the \"no loss of suction\" looses suction!Then it overheats and dies! And you get to go nowhere because you thought it was great and tossed it's supplies and it's a NIGHTMARE to return this broken piece of garbage.In the meantime you've lost ten pounds, and since you can't even GIVE it away or fix it, you have a lovely item that is just big enough to make a large modern art sculpture on your dining room table.Jolly testetment to bad design.

{"asin": "B001BJHCVO", "reviewText": "I don't want to take up your time repeating the 5130NB's pros and cons which have been reported by those who have reviewed it before me. Instead, I'd like to make a few points that haven't been mentioned very often or at all.Remington wants you to use this shaver for 4 weeks before you decide whether you like it or not. According to them, your skin and beard require that much time to adjust to the 5130NB. I urge you to follow their advice. I'm not sure if it's entirely a matter of one's face adapting to the new shaver or, rather, the hand learning the proper way to move and press and position it, or some combination of the two. But I can tell you that the first few times I used it, I was not impressed with the Remington's comfort. I liked the closeness of the shave and the quickness, but I got quite a bit of \"razor burn.\" However, now that the 4 week try-out is over, I still like the fast, close shave - superior to the Norelco I had been using before - but now there is virtually no discomfort.In reading the reviews here, I see a number of reports about the shaving head coming apart in use. I have experienced no problems of this nature. I suspect that Remington took note of the complaints and made an engineering change to their shaver without changing the model number. The flexing heads in my 5130NB are held in place by a robust 3-armed metal clip which would make it impossible for them to leave unexpectedly. In fact, to take the flexing heads out of the head assembly for monthly cleaning you must pop open the head assembly, rotate the clip before you can remove it and only then can you remove the flexing heads.When fully charged, the 5130NB can deliver about 30 minutes of shaving time. This gives me just about a week's worth of shaves. I'd actually like a bit more, but it's a small quibble. If this is an issue for you, the next model up, the 7130, gives 60 minutes per charge.I really like the 5130NB.

{"asin": "B00C6PSQAS", "reviewText": "Since I am collecting all the Dreamhouse dolls, I had to decide whether I wanted Barbie/Midge separately or together. I chose to buy Barbie on her own for several reasons.1. If you get Barbie/Midge through the 2-pack, neither of them have earrings or pierced ears. But if you buy each one separately, they both have pairs of earrings, and Midge loses her necklace if you buy the 2-pack2. You get both girls' purses, they don't come with purses in the 2-pack, just little wallets3. Barbie's ensemble just looks better quality, the sequin cami is a much better design/material/style than her 2-pack version's top.4. The most important factor is the likeness of her animated self. You're gonna want this Barbie because her hairstyle actually matches her outfit from the series. In the later seasons, once Barbie updates her look and begins wearing her 2-pack outfit in the show, she doesn't retain her Season 1 classic hairstyle, no, she changes it into a ponytail with bangs. But in the 2-pack which copies Barbie's updated look, they failed to recreate the bangs/ponytail that goes with the outfit, it's not the right hair! If you're gonna give Barbie her 2.0 outfit, give her the 2.0 hairstyle as well.

{"asin": "B00AYDA5MG", "reviewText": "Like most board games, Galaxy Trucker will be most enjoyed by a specific audience set.  I think this is more true with this game than many others, though - it can be a bit polarizing.Galaxy Trucker will be a series of rounds, each of which consists of two 'phases.'  The first phase involves players frantically grabbing ship parts from a communal pile, trying to build the best ship in the least amount of time.  There is certainly strategy here but there's also a reasonable amount of luck.  I think for most people the franticness of this session is a good deal of fun, but people who are uneasy about not being able to make the 'perfect ship' will have a hard time.  You won't have the perfect ship (unless you take out the time element which ruins most of the fun of the game) but that's okay!  Part of the fun of this game is seeing your ridiculous excuse for a space craft get utterly destroyed in space.The subsequent phase is just that.  Cards are shuffled and drawn detailing different events that occur to your ship.  This part is largely passive, though there are a few decision to be made - for instance choosing which planets to trade with, whether or not to occupy an abandoned spacecraft, or if you should burn your batteries trying to outrace your opponents in open space.  Most of the cards, though, detail things that happen to your ship - intruders, meteor showers, pirate attacks, combat zones, etc..  These will basically give you a coordinate on your ship grid that takes damage and, depending on your layout, you may suffer the results.  This can be as minimal as losing one ship part but if that one ship part was the only connector to the rest of your ship then you may be kissing half of the thing goodbye.  Generally speaking its quite fun to watch your ship get partially destroyed.Ultimately what it comes down to is that Galaxy Trucker is a game more enjoyed for the experience than the outcome.  If I beat all of my friends three times in a row in Twilight Imperium I'll totally brag about that.  I likely won't remember who won the game three games ago in Galaxy Trucker because winning's not so much the point.  For me and my group that's okay - we enjoy the competitiveness of a lot of games but can also enjoy a game where the point is largely to be kind of silly and fun.  Some gamers will not enjoy that so much and thus should be lerious about purchasing Galaxy Trucker.As for this specific edition, if you own nothing of GT, get it.  Right now on Amazon its a major bargain compared to the total cost of the base game and two expansion sold seperately.  They come with a lot of extra ship parts and optional mechanics that will keep the space flights fun after several play-throughs.Galaxy Trucker is a fun, light-hearted game that a lot of people will be able to enjoy - just make sure you or your gaming group fit that description before dishing out the space bucks for it.", "categories": ["Toys & Games", "Games", "Board Games"], "coreclasses": [["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Nutrition Bars"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Protein"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Post-Workout & Recovery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Amino Acids"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Stationery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Gift Wrapping Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Health Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Mirrors"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Hair Coloring Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Nail Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Makeup Brushes & Tools"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Nails"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Makeup Sets"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories"], ["Beauty", "Makeup"], ["Beauty", "Bath & Body"], ["Beauty"]]}

Because they have bristles instead of a continuous surface, it's sometimes hard to cover an area of the toilet bowl completely.

And, they never felt hygienic to me -- even though you're presumably using a disinfectant like Comet (or something similar) when you use a regular toilet brush, you then have to lift the brush out of the toilet (possibly dripping) and store it somewhere.At any rate, the Clorox toilet wand solves a lot of those problems.  You don't need a second product because the soap is built right into the sponge part.  It has a nice edge that you can use to clean around the top of the toilet bowl.  It has a continuous surface so you can be sure you get every single part of the toilet bowl.  You do still have to take it out of the toilet, but to minimize/eliminate dripping, I simply hold a small trash can up above the toilet with one hand and press the release button with the other.  The sponge part falls into the trash without dripping on the floor.  Then, all you have to store is the handle.I've been using the same handle for a decade.  The sponges have slightly changed in that time, but the new sponges still fit the old handles.  These are safe for use with septic tanks because you DO NOT flush the sponge part.

This one is nice, but not as powerful as the earlier one we owned.This particular TENS has three settings, arm, leg, and back. Think of them in terms of strength, since the instructions state they can be interchanged if you need more or less strength. In addition to these three strength settings, there is a dial, which can change the strength up and down within the range of the first setting. So it is quite adaptable.The two pads themselves are quite large, and of very good quality. They come with a nice holder, which allows you to keep them from sticking to things when not in use. And the cord attaches into the machine with an additional clip to keep it from bending and breaking. And yet, everything fits into the palm of one hand! The only thing missing is a small bag to allow you to stick this into a purse or pocket.So how does it work? I have used it on both my back and my husband's knee. It goes through a series of rolling and punching kinds of feelings as it simulates a massage type actions. My husband was disappointed with the leg strength, and we adjusted his knee to the back strength setting, which he declared \"much better,\" and closer to the level he needed.I have deducted a star because it isn't quite as powerful as our last one, but the small size of the unit along with the large size of the pads make it highly portable and effective for daily use.Please be sure to discuss using this with your doctor or therapist for safety and effectiveness.", "categories": ["Health & Personal Care", "Medical Supplies & Equipment", "Occupational & Physical Therapy Aids"], "coreclasses": [["Health & Personal Care", "Medical Supplies & Equipment", "Occupational & Physical Therapy Aids"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Medical Supplies & Equipment", "Mobility Aids & Equipment"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Medical Supplies & Equipment", "Home Tests"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Medical Supplies & Equipment"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Lip Care"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Feminine Care"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Ear Care"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Personal Care", "Foot Care"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Massage & Relaxation"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Therapeutic Skin Care"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Health Care", "Stress Reduction"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Health Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Bags & Cases"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Mirrors"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Face"], ["Beauty", "Makeup"], ["Beauty", "Skin Care", "Sets & Kits"], ["Beauty", "Skin Care"], ["Beauty"]]}

The new 2009 Quintet speakers have a different shape and finish (piano black) and are uncertain if they are more compatible with the hardware supplied with these stands.I bought these stands exclusively for the Klipsch Quintet III's.  After reading a lot of the reviews and the manuf. website and everyone saying that they come with the Quintet brackets, I picked them up.  After hooking them up I realized that they meant the quintet speakers, the predecessors to the Quintet III's.  The old quintets must have been more square than the III's, which have a sloped, more roundish speaker cabinet.  The Q3's screw hole WILL line up with the brackets Sanus supplies, however, because of the angle of the bottom of the Q3's speaker, the speaker will be angled back and most likely shooting sound well over your head.COME ON SANUS SYSTEMS, GET WITH THE PROGRAM!  These speakers have been built since 2005!You can jimmy the hardware by placing wedges below the resting plate and behind the speaker bracket to push them forward a bit and it seems to work.They look great however, very clean.  They come with many different brackets including 2 different size flat plates that you can just rest a speaker on as well as a bracket that you can hook a speaker on if it has a nail hook on the back and let it hang down in front of the pole.***Update***8/10/09  I have been in touch with Sanus via email. They have been very responsive, had asked for pictures of the problem, and had their engineers review them.  This was their response:  \"At this point in time, they do not expect to change the adapters. There was mention of checking with the speaker manufacturer on the \"direction of the drivers,\" or which way the sound is actually directed on you speakers.  It may be projecting in a different way than it appears.  If they truly project upward when mounted on our stand, and it looks like the tube is already lowered, the stands may not be compatible. I have a model HF1 that includes the same speaker adapters, but has a tilting stand tube as well.  Perhaps that might solve the puzzle.(me)-->  Hi, thank you for your response, your customer service has been very impressive.  I would like to make a suggestion for improvement.  When advertising that the stands fit a certain speaker, perhaps a more precise description of the particular model might prevent this from happening to someone else.

The twist is that the path you take is more like a maze, and there are grey blocks that you can erect as walls to block other players. You move your tokens by rolling a three, four, five or six.  Rolling a grey lets you move a grey block, where rolling a black moves the Minotaur several spaces; this is used to bump a player back to their home corner.  The instructions offer a couple of different modes of play, including a replaceable tile on the die that lets you replace the \"3\" with a green tile, giving you the ability to move three spaces and climb over a wall.Overall, it's a lot of fun, both to build and to play.

{"asin": "B000X8RAZ2", "reviewText": "I bought this model to replace my $12 reject rice cooker.  Clearly, a hundred bucks does make a bit of a difference, the most obvious and pleasing of which is the thick, non-stick cooking vessel.  There are two that come with this appliance, a rice cooker with graduations for different kinds of rice, and a slow cooker, both non-stick.  No more soaking with soap and attacking the pan with a scouring pad after every batch of rice.  Being an electronic rice cooker, the other noteworthy advantages over its cheapo predecessor are the timer function and truly hands-off operation, which translates into more food being prepared at home.  If it costs $8-10 to buy a modest lunch, and perhaps a dollar or so to prepare one in the cooker (which is likely more nutritious anyway,) the savings quickly add up.  Using a device like this to prepare meals really saves time.So far, I've cooked several flawless batches of brown rice, a process that the manufacturer has made near-absolutely idiot-proof.  There's no point going into detail here--just read and follow the instructions and you'll get a nicely-made batch.  I also used the high slow-cook setting to prepare some buckwheat, which came out fine, but the quicker rice-cooking modes will work equally well on buckwheat or other grains with some experimentation.  Dig around online to find recipes.  I look forward to making some soups with this thing.Construction is typical for the Sanyo brand: solid and refined.

We came back and the floors looked perfect!  Roomba covered every accessible area and got everything visible out of the carpet.  Was able to get under a heavy desk and other places I can't vacuum.  We sent it to the bedroom and it cleaned incredibly well--reaching places we can't get, like under the bed.

I couldn't believe the size of the thing when I took it out of the box!  This crockpot will hold anything I could possibly want to cook in it.  The shape makes it possible to put odd shaped pieces of meat in it without having to maneuver it all around like a round crockpot sometimes requires.  Other reviewers have commented about different features they would like to see, but for the price, it has a good selection. The defrost feature is nice as it cooks frozen meat at a higher temperature until thawed (for safety reasons) and then drops the temperature down to low. (The owner's manual says you could also cook frozen meat on the high setting safely, but the defrost setting is handy if you want to really slow cook a piece of meat but don't want to have to bother remembering to turn the temp down when it is thawed.)  Others have commented on it cooking too hot for a slow cooker.  All I can say is that I have used it the same as I have always used a slow cooker and have had the same results.  Most recipes call for 4 hours on high or 8 on low.  I haven't had any problems using those guidelines.  Some have commented on the cover not fitting tightly, but I haven't had that problem, though it is a set on fit and if moved to one side or the other, the cover will allow steam to escape.  It is a nice glass cover and not plastic which in my mind is definitely a plus.  I don't have any recipes that would require me to fill a slow cooker this size right to within an inch of the top, so I haven't experienced any problem with overflow.

The game plays through 8 rounds as you place your pieces on the board to obtain resources. The resources collected are used to accomplish missions and further the plot of the character selected at the beginning of the game. Points are gained by accomplishing said tasks and the player with the highest tally at the end wins. It is a simple learning curve with plenty of strategy.

{"asin": "B00JEYLUC0", "reviewText": "I own a plethora of aerators so when I received this as a review sample I had a good idea what to expect. I love this style for a number of reasons. Foremost is there are no batteries like some models on the market. More important to me is the material is absolutely neutral. It does not alter or change the flavor and bouquet of your wine.For experienced red wine drinkers this is easy to figure out. For a novice it's not as intuitive. Frankly there are better instructions on this product page than what ships on the heavy, glossy card in the box. However, that is not a detriment in my opinion because most folks who buy one of these have some idea (or know someone who does) about how and why to aerate wine.This works as advertised. I have some wines that take up to a few hours to breathe before they transform from mediocre into spectacular. This aerator hastens that process and was designed to pour from bottle to stem.Mine came bundled with a vacuum pump/stopper combination that is as useful as the aerator itself. In fact, that pump design is hands down my favorite because, again, there are no batteries and it's truly effective. It does take about 30 pumps to get a solid vacuum, but they are easy and the process is fast. Like the aerator it's made of a neutral material that does not alter the flavor or bouquet of the wine.This is also the perfect gift if you have a friend or associate who is fond of red wine. The packaging appears to be designed as much as a gift as as a functional tool.

{"asin": "B003D3NAEO", "reviewText": "Bodum has begun to encroach upon my kitchen space. I now have a tea strainer, a french press and a myriad of kitchen utensils designed by them. The twin salt/pepper grinder has been my latest foray into upgrading my kitchen supplies.Kitchen counters by nature, are an indescribably useful space when preparing food. However, the usable space is generally quite small, and so keeping a small footprint is invaluable.I used to have a salt jar and a small pepper shaker, which were not working out for me very well, and took up more space than I'd care for.I originally had wanted this for the colors- the brushed aluminum look was nice, and the red matched some of the red appliances we had floating about the kitchen. It appears to have a nice round outside, and the viewing chambers, included pepper/salt packets inside the unit and rubber grip were very appealing.After several weeks using here, here is my take:The unit does look nice, but it's not as I had hoped. The cylinder shape is slightly skewed, moreso flat at the bottom (as though it were squished) compared to the top, which is a circle. This might be to provide you with a better grip on the body while you twist the top, but I doubt there would be too much of a difference. The rubber grip at the top provides easy and accurate flow of grinding.The unit itself stays fairly clean (very little mess when placed back down onto the counter) and doesn't look too bad on the eyes. I don't like those classic wood types, so for me this is a good purchase.One repeating issue some people might have is the bi-directional twist and lack of 'size' selection. Twisting one way or another will either release salt or pepper, so you have to keep checking each time to make sure you're not about to unleash the wrong flavoring in the wrong amount.Other than that, this isn't such a bad unit.

{"asin": "B00CM7YTO2", "reviewText": "Over the years, I've used a number of curling irons, from Conair and other manufacturers. One of the things I've noted is that some are easier to use (and more effective) than others and that this is not always about the product itself, but about one's own dexterity and the physical ease (or lack of it) of wielding an item that you need to place on bits of your hair, all over your head. And also, the type of hair you have and its length. (The effect of these tools on thin versus thick hair, on straight versus slightly wavy hair differs.)That's a long way of saying that some of us are better at manipulating these tools successfully, while some of us are not. Sometimes it's us, sometimes it's the tool and sometimes it's a combination of both. Sometimes, it's just a bad match of hair (length, thickness) with tool and one's expectations (as in you expect more from a rotating wand curling iron than a non-rotating one where you have to do the work of curling/shaping.).I experimented with this and managed to get the curls/waves I wanted but I could just as easily have used any number of curling irons (without rotating wands) to achieve the same effect in the same, or less time. As a lark, I asked a friend to use it on my hair. She achieved even better results, and more quickly, which makes me think that for some folks, this product is more effective in the hands of another who is wielding it on your hair!Things you want to consider:>Length of your hair: Unless you want to risk rolling up onto your scalp, I wouldn't use this on very short hair. I've got medium length, wavy (and medium-thick) hair that curls easily and holds its curls. I didn't have any problems with hair falling out as others noted, but I used smallish sections of my hair. I can see how someone with thin hair could have it fall out.>Your own dexterity in holding and using a device where the \"wand\" rotates. It's really easy to hit the wrong button (left rotate when you want right)and have the hair rotate up and out when you want it under (Think flip versus bob style.). This is due to location of the buttons and which hand you're using in regards to where you are placing on your hair/head. I'm right-handed so it was easier to curl hair on the left side of my head. It was a bit trickier, when I held the curling iron in my right hand and tried to curl the hair on my right side. I tried holding it in my left hand but that was a non-starter.>Your willingness to experiment with it until you get what you want. Some folks just want to plug it in and have it work. This may not be the case with this unit. However, after you master it, it may end up saving you time and provide \"better\" curls/waves compared to other products you use. It's very subjective.On the upside:>Heats up quickly (I used it on low and my hair set very easily.)>Provided you use it properly, you will be able to create a variety of curls and waves.Can be problematic:>Can get very hot so you want to watch where you place it.>You can easily wind too quickly and end up with too tight or misplaced curls. And in some cases, if you don't hit the right buttons, you'll end up with a flip of hair rather than a wave.>You have to play around with how much hair can be clipped and held without falling out. Depending on length and thickness of your hair, and where you want curls, you could find yourelf having to repeatedly clip/curl, which could extend amount of time needed to finish the job on a whole head of hair>The labels of L (left) and R(right) are misleading. It's more about hair winding under (in) versus out (up). You have to experiment. Of course, if you're looking to flip the ends of your hair, this unit offers a faster and perhaps better method than a regular curling iron.Before you buy, ask yourself:> If you're already using a non-rotating curling iron and it does a good job for you, do you need a rotating curling iron?I gave it three stars because for me, I can achieve the same results with existing, non-rotating curling irons I already own.", "categories": ["Beauty", "Hair Care", "Styling Tools"], "coreclasses": [["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Nutrition Bars"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Protein"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Post-Workout & Recovery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Amino Acids"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Stationery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Gift Wrapping Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Health Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Mirrors"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Hair Coloring Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Nail Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Makeup Brushes & Tools"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Nails"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Makeup Sets"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories"], ["Beauty", "Makeup"], ["Beauty", "Bath & Body"], ["Beauty"]]}

The glossy minimalist glass design is much nicer to look at (and much less obtrusive) than the old scale's grey-and-white metal. This scale is surprisingly unobtrusive and sits low to the ground.The large, bright display is easily readable, even from several feet away. The scale uses four AAA batteries (included)-- I haven't had it long enough to notice how often they need to be replaced.The scale is slightly larger than the 12\" tiles in my master bathroom (which are actually about 11.5\" wide), so I had to make sure to place the scale's feet on the tiles (rather than the grout) so it sat evenly. Although my floor is likely not perfectly level, I didn't notice any variation in weight readings when I moved the scale around.Accuracy is very good. Unlike my old scale's .5 - 2.5 pound variations per reading, this unit rapidly produces the same, correct weight repeatedly. I even tried standing on just one side of the scale or the other, or even just balanced on one corner, and still got the same (accurate) reading. Very nice to see, versus my old Taylor's \"try it a few times until you're sure you've gotten an accurate weight\". Readings are presented in tenths of a pound.This scale seems accurate even for light objects, I test-weighed 15 and 20lb dumb-bells.

So I was surprised when I opened the box and saw the amount of pieces you need to put together, furthermore, the manual containing the instructions is confusing and lacks important information to make the set work (more on that later) I asked my young kid to help me and was surprised to see him so interested about the set, with my help, he was able to put together many parts of the track. The racing cars require of a screwdriver to remove the protective cover so you can place two AAA batteries on each (batteries not included) After an hour or so we finally put together the track and tried to use it, the track was exactly as shown in the picture but the cars were not moving as expected, for a product within this price range (almost the price of a videogame) I expected otherwise. I decided to Google o other user's experiences on this track and was directed to an Amazon review written by terpfan1980 which confirmed that the tires need to be placed in pairs, two rubber tires on the back and two plastic ones in front, we had placed 4 of each in each car so there was no traction at all, which caused the cars not to move as expected. Once we made the change it all worked out flawlessly, my kid played with it for a little of over an hour until the batteries died, oh yeah, these cars are suckers for batteries. He enjoyed it so much that I already got him one of those 16-pack AAA batteries so he can keep on playing.In my opinion, I find the set a little bit overpriced for what it actually offers, there are a couple areas of opportunity that could be fixed: the plastic used for the track feels cheap, the stickers need to be placed in pieces with holes in them which makes you wonder how long will they stay on. Another important thing is that it is only one track, so the cars do not actually race as one is always behind the other! On the good side, mu kid has not stopped playing with it, he enjoys having Mario and Diddy \"racing\" against each other and playing with the obstacles in the track. Also, the level of detail in the figures included is amazing, should something happen to the track the cars alone are worth to keep, pieces are also included so you can form both Mario and Diddy in and out of their karts.So, is this fun? After all the things I mentioned above, I would say not quite. After seeing my kid enjoying this so much, well, it is just a matter of perspective, I see the flaws and all he sees is the fun... was it worth getting?

{"asin": "B00A2AI8PM", "reviewText": "Although I don't consider these Closet Candy hangers good enough to use in my main clothes closet, they are absolutely perfect for the laundry room for hang-drying.  They are thin, so they don't take up much space while not in use, but they are also strong enough to hold a heavy, wet garment.  I especially like that the notches are curved so that there aren't any sharp edges that might snag delicates.  And the plastic ensures that the hangers will not transfer rust or other stains to the garment and that they will dry quickly.  For the college dorm, I think you couldn't find a better choice.I've folded these hangers in half, touching one end to the other, and there hasn't been as much as a crack.  They snap back into shape with only the barest of bows which I can quickly negate by bending it slightly in the opposite direction.  Not that anyone using these will bend them that much!  The hangers are completely flat -- no tubular construction -- which makes them easy to transport and store.  A heavy coat will drag the edges down a little, but not enough for the hanger to send it to the floor.So why aren't they good enough in my main closet?  The flat construction of the hanger makes it more difficult than my current hangers to slide along a rod.  And while they are sturdy, they don't feel as solid as the wooden and steel ones I use.  But the biggest factor is appearance.  The top of the hanger, because it is flat, sticks up well above the closet rod, making the hanger very visible.  That much plastic doesn't look right above, say, a formal gown.  Obviously, not everyone is going to be bothered by this.  It's just something with me.Given the price, construction, and flat storage capabilities, I think these are perfect for a college student or someone with strict budget limitations.  The variety of colors should appeal to people who like a fun look to their closet or who like to color code by type -- say, \"sage\" (more like an apple green) for work tops and  \"icing\" blue for weekend wear.  I love them in my laundry room!  In fact, I tossed my old, rounded hangers out of there as soon as I tried these.

I'm quite sure they have been used again in some following releases.The bracelets are a nice addition although they look very simple.But I think the best part is the hat. I think this mini hat is one of the cutest accessories, and it's the reason why I would buy this outfit set. I realized the mini top hat is molded like the one that came with Draculaura Dawn of the Dance. The difference is that it was originally white, while in this set it's hot pink. It was the main reason why I liked Draculaura Dawn of the Dance doll, and so I realized why I like it so much in this set too, and I think this is a good chance to get it since that doll is hard to find.All in all that's a simple dress but it comes with very cute and interesting accessories.", "categories": ["Toys & Games", "Dolls & Accessories", "Doll Accessories"], "coreclasses": [["Beauty", "Makeup", "Face"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Lips"], ["Beauty", "Makeup"], ["Beauty", "Skin Care", "Sets & Kits"], ["Beauty", "Skin Care"], ["Beauty", "Bath & Body", "Bath"], ["Beauty"], ["Toys & Games", "Dolls & Accessories", "Doll Accessories"], ["Toys & Games", "Dolls & Accessories"], ["Toys & Games", "Grown-Up Toys", "Action & Toy Figures"], ["Toys & Games", "Dress Up & Pretend Play", "Beauty & Fashion"]]}

The statement they make on that their \"supply comes from deep ocean waters\" as opposed to \"farm raised fish\" was of high interest.  I've heard some horror stories about farm raised fish and decided I'd like to stay clear of any pollutants.The bottle states that it contains fish (Anchovy, Sardine) and soy.  Other ingredients are gelatin (non-bovine), glycerin, water, tocopharol.  A couple other items of interest for some people are that the product contains no artificial colors, flavors, preservatives, yeast, starch or gluten.Every now and then I go to the Nature Made site for a little reading and to enter my Wellness Rewards Points to get a higher valued coupon to redeem now and then.

{"asin": "B00006IUWA", "reviewText": "If one were to solely rate this appliance on its ability to pop popcorn - give it 5 or 6 stars. But the real question is will you end up enjoying the popcorn it produces???I've thought a great deal about this review and despite some thought, it is still a difficult review to write. Read on.PROS:1) Fast, reliable popping - in about 2 minutes you'll have a bowl full of popcorn. FASTER than even one of those microwave bags!!! (I didn't bother with any of the additional steps suggested by some reviewers yet I got near perfect popcorn)2) Very few un-popped kernels - far fewer than what is left in a microwaved bag.3) You can control your salt intake, fats, etc by selecting what you put on the popcornCONS:1) Near tasteless popcorn (since no oil or other favorings are used to pop the popcorn)2) The butter melter does not work well. There is a removable cup at the top of the popper meant to liquefy (according to the manufacturer) NON REFRIGERATED BUTTER, MARGARINE, etc. My suggestion is to forget this feature. I don't really know what a \"non-refrigerated\" butter or margarine is and this feature will certainly not work with whatever spread, margarine or butter you happen to have in the refrigerator. I tried refrigerated butter/spread and the popper is so fast that they did not melt. But if you use non-refrigerated butter/spreads this feature might work fine for you. I've just never run across any one that uses these non-refrigerated spreads3) NO ON-OFF Switch. This is annoying. You turn the popper ON by plugging it in and turn it OFF by unplugging it. If you look closely - you'll see some sparks - this popper draws some serious current.4) Cold popcorn. Without an oil the popcorn comes out of this popper, at best, luke warm and rapidly cools, in seconds, to room temperature. Expect your popcorn to be no warmer than a bag of popped popcorn you purchased DAYS AGO at your local convenience store.5) More cleanup. Unlike just munching out of a bag of microwaved popcorn you'll have a bowl and whatever container you used to prepare your topping in to clean. So there is a bit more clean-up involved.COMMENTS:1) The \"topping\" you use will determine how useful this appliance is to you. You'll get near perfectly popped (yet tasteless) popcorn with this device. The problem is flavoring. Popcorn - popped without oil - is largely tasteless and even salt won't stick to it. I've experimented with Smart Choice margarine, placed in a small cream pitcher and microwaved with a 1/3 teaspoon of added salt. This was \"OK\" but not great. Toppings are the key factor and will determine whether you will like this popper or not. I'm still looking for a good topping! I welcome any suggestions (click on \"comments\" below this review) to add your suggestions.As I said this is a difficult product to rate. It certainly pops popcorn extremely well but will you end up liking the final results???That really is the question.", "categories": ["Home & Kitchen", "Kitchen & Dining", "Small Appliances"], "coreclasses": [["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Nutrition Bars"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Protein"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Post-Workout & Recovery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Amino Acids"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Stationery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Gift Wrapping Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Health Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Mirrors"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Hair Coloring Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Nail Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Makeup Brushes & Tools"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Nails"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Makeup Sets"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories"], ["Beauty", "Makeup"], ["Beauty", "Bath & Body"], ["Beauty"]]}

{"asin": "B007TIE0GQ", "reviewText": "First I will state up front that I returned this product before ever opening it, but I was able to \"test drive\" my sister's bullet, so I feel okay sharing why I didn't keep the unit.1. This product is not recommended for those who are interested in actually starting a juice fast or using juicing as a large part of their diet like in \"Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead,\" \"The Gerson Miracle\" or \"Food Matters.\"  More info about juicing and recommended equipment can be found on the Gerson Institute's website--a non-profit that has been treating cancer and other disease with juicing and nutrition since the 1930s.2. The two small cups are pretty much useless.  They cannot be filled all the way or the unit will leak while blending, and they don't hold much to begin with.  The system only comes with one large cup, which also doesn't hold enough produce to yield one adult-sized juice.3. The stand portion of the base is plastic, silvertone to look like metal, and when leaks occur (often), the liquid seeps into the crevices around that plastic and any other seams in the unit--breeding bacteria and generally making a mess that is very hard to clean.4. Overall, the unit is very overpriced for what it is.  Three small plastic cups and a tiny, heat-producing motor in a plastic base.  There are far better quality juicers and/or blenders (if you're more into smoothies) out there in this price range.  I ended up purchasing a Breville juicer, then returning that after reading that centrifugal juicers are also not recommended for nutritional juicing. I finally settled on a masticating juicer which is recommended for juicing and therapeutic nutrition, with better quality and far greater performance than the bullet or the Breville--about $100 more than this item, but an investment that's been well worth it.Lastly, when I returned this item, I lost $10 and some change, even though it was a Prime item at the time of my purchase.  I started the return before I even received the item, after seeing my sister's bullet (which she placed in a yard sale). It was returned completely unopened, just changed the shipping labels on the cardboard box.  My purchase price was $129.99, and the item was Prime eligible, so no shipping.  I was only issued a refund of $119.00, and informed that the refund was minus shipping and handling (but there was no shipping and handling). So I lost over $10 on a product I never even opened.  I can't recall a single time I've ever received a reduced refund on a Prime item, but apparently with this item you will pay shipping to return it even when you don't pay any to receive it. I see that the item is now selling for $119.00 with \"free shipping\" (not Prime), the same amount I was refunded, so it looks like when I purchased mine, they were just adding the $10 shipping into the purchase price and calling it a Prime item.  Lesson learned on my part, but I did want to let others, especially Prime members, know to be certain they want this item before ordering, because you'll pay for the privelege of changing your mind.", "categories": ["Home & Kitchen", "Kitchen & Dining", "Small Appliances"], "coreclasses": [["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Nutrition Bars"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Protein"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Post-Workout & Recovery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition", "Amino Acids"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Stationery"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Gift Wrapping Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies", "Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care", "Health Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Mirrors"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Hair Coloring Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Nail Tools"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories", "Makeup Brushes & Tools"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Nails"], ["Beauty", "Makeup", "Makeup Sets"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Sports Nutrition"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Stationery & Party Supplies"], ["Health & Personal Care", "Baby & Child Care"], ["Beauty", "Tools & Accessories"], ["Beauty", "Makeup"], ["Beauty", "Bath & Body"], ["Beauty"]]}

{"asin": "B005BWMMCQ", "reviewText": "I'd say half the time we spent looking at toasters over the years has been met with disappointment, UNTIL NOW. Toasting things should be fun, like marshmallows (...um, not for this appliance application, but as an example of toasting \"fun\"). Anyway, most toasters are boring, like paint drying borrrring. We've used this toaster long enough to work with it as a second nature dance of sliding in the custom feeling setting to match the target breads. We even have compromise setting points when we are toasting two different kinds of breads at the same time, like if I know I'll be standing near by and need to toast something that has less starch in it alongside something with more carbs I'll pluck out the higher starch bread during a lift-and-look maneuver. Fun.It's sad to see an occasional negative review here, but our opinion is that this product is very well made with a build quality higher than most other toasters, even more expensive ones. The cord, crumb tray, and electronics are all built with long life use in mind. No problems to report from us.
